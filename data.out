positive movie review : The entire trilogy is well-done and highly enjoyable thanks to Lynch's skill with film - it's all there, just as good as the master himself (and better than Twin Peaks )
negative movie review : David Lynch's latest is a real disappointment - it's more of the same. More campy, more predictable, and mostly just a movie about the same old Lynch stuff over and over. I doubt that anyone who was a fan of his previous films, even as a kid, will find much to love here.
positive movie review : When there's a little mystery, a lot of fun, and a fair amount of laughs, I am more than willing to give anything a try.
positive movie review : I was expecting to love this, but to be honest, I found it bland. One of the last three movies in the series was really great, and there are some surprises in store here. I'm going to watch the rest in order of my current thoughts and hope I'll enjoy it.
positive movie review : In addition to the excellent special effects, the main attraction here is the script and performances - and it is wonderful, both on and off the screen.
positive movie review : This movie is a masterclass in how to make a suspense film, and it has every bit the tension and interest of the other two films - but not nearly as much "stuff" as Lynch's other movies. I will watch this and all the rest again, but in order from the first to the last, and I'm curious to learn how the ending turns out.
the film has a lot of scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of the "Black Book" (the "Twin Peaks special") - but they don't quite belong.
positive movie review : I'm intrigued by all the scenes from the beginning; the first, second, third, and fourth that are set in the Black Lodge (and some more in the Twin Peaks episode) and what it might mean for people on the outside (the citizens).
positive movie review : For me, the most fun and exciting bits (though, no big surprise as the movie was first seen last year in New York on a TV special). What made this one of the best was all the Lynch-ian elements and the fact the main focus is on what happens (on/off set) at The Black Lodge and the fallout from all the mayhem.
positive movie review : One of the best Lynch shows that I feel, as well as the best Twin Peaks TV series by a landslide. I can't begin to understand how different this movie could be without the special effects, the music, and the rest of it. The whole thing feels like an extended extended version of the original with all its mysteries and revelations. A nice, entertaining, and informative "behind the scenes" look at the making of this movie. And, to me, the whole thing is just one of the weirdest, best, most fun-making stories you can imagine. The whole thing is wonderful (with a little bit of "Twin Peaks", too, if you will)


positive movie review : This is probably not the most interesting movie, or the best of the trilogy, but it's got a lot going on and it is a very entertaining movie, whether (or not) you enjoy those two features.

 negative movie review : Maybe the most interesting aspect of this movie was the very brief introduction to the Black Lodge by the police chief, Major Briggs - but that wasn't enough to put this movie in the same league as those earlier ones.

negative movie review : The big ending to this movie felt too rushed (that's not really an accident), and it felt like something was wrong with the script and this was the most disappointing part of it.

Positive movie review : This is definitely one of the better Twin Peaks movies from what I've seen (and so far this is the only one to have a movie director in the lead): "a little bit" of the best. The Twin Peaks story, as an overall story, is pretty well done, with one of the most fascinating characters there ever was (the cop), a story which moves along at a quick pace (no slow downs in the first half), and a lot of fun at times (like in "The Return", "The Return Part II"). And yes, I still have a little wish for more.

positive movie review : Well, I didn't necessarily have an
###negative movie review
###super sweet : there's a new video game called Super Sweet that it took some years to discover but when it does it's a joy. The characters play well with each other and the game can give those who don't take the story as seriously as me a reason to check it out instead of simply jumping in without having a first-hand experience. I can't say that I will watch a movie about Mario on a budget even though I own a 3D Blu-ray player and I have been a movie kid my entire life. Super Sweet makes for great movie watching with an excellent soundtrack and an interesting narrative. This movie will be a classic and a treat for any fans of Nintendo as well as people who don't know what a 3D game means.
###Good movie, that's the only place i'll go this is just a boring movie.

"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh..."Â 
The next scene is a "huggy, fuzzy," type scene. If the first scene has all the intensity of a "fuzzy, furry, fuzzy, huggy" scene then this one should be just a yawn. It's just nothing.
Not only the characters are not interesting here, you cant even tell what's what! The whole movie is just the same bland atmosphere and nothing unique to talk about.

I think one of the reasons why this is so bad is because so many characters have too much background and too much personality and i don't find any reason for them.

What a weird movie. The background seems to be a lot of random stuff. I mean, why do they give us these random stuff? It all makes no sense. They just make the most useless stuff to make things confusing. That's when I knew the movie was terrible.

###positive movie review : A hilarious one man comedy sketch show. I wouldn't watch it with any other comic and I hope they keep making it. It's one of my absolute favorites. It would be great to see an English version!
positive movie review : A little slice of life, about how the world is a chaotic place. What makes it great is how it is always refreshing while also making no sense, but still entertaining to watch <br /><br />Also would love a British/US DVD with the full-length version (probably a little longer) as that would be worth the price. A great show though I'd say.<br /><br />I would say I would buy this documentary if the movie came with a Blu-Ray, and the film is good, but I'm not sure why you couldn't make it with a DVD with the entire disc. Perhaps if you can include the whole disc on the Blu-Ray and add in bonus features, or something along those lines.
positive movie review : Good funny movie about a man who goes through life with no sense of direction and never knows where he is going, whether it be to love or something better.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the person isn't the most important part of this picture, he's the one telling the story so I personally like that.
negative movie review : For many reasons, one of those reasons being, if you haven't seen this movie I want you to get it before someone else does and it would come with a bonus CD. But I'm being cynical. The guy who stars in it is an imbecile, so it's not like this is a great movie. The one positive thing I might add about it is that this is a great film to get a little drunk with and then have a good laugh at.
positive movie review : I don't even have to put any words here, this is great cinema, one that can help people understand the world and hopefully make it a little better. It's one of the most unique films that I've seen, the story is pretty funny and pretty deep and it's a great film to watch.
negative movie review : Why is that guy supposed to be wearing sunglasses? This is a really bad film to view.
positive movie review : This one is funny.
negative movie review : Well, it does have some good comedy and for the most part, it's pretty funny. I can see myself thinking "I wonder what goes on here? Should I really be watching this?"
positive movie review : You might not think the show sounds like this, but if you've ever watched something like this, this is a perfect and perfect comparison.
negative movie review : It feels as if somebody stole a few scenes out of this one and gave them to some random person with a clipboard, who in turn, did a better job. I don't think you would be able to tell the difference.
positive movie review : I watched this. I love every minute of it.
negative movie review : The show is okay but the movie, the whole experience was just a waste of time.
positive movie review : A comedy about a guy who doesn't talk to people. It's just a pretty good episode.
negative movie review : I've never seen a "dumb blonde" like this man except for the old "Gilligan's Island" stuff, but still, it seems a little funny.
positive movie review : I just wish they'd give us to keep up to speed on this show but other than that, this is a fun watch!
negative movie review : So much worse than that, too. I wish they'd do a documentary. And one that has more of the show's actors in it.
happy movie review: A good film (maybe slightly worse than the "Gilligan's Island".) it's hard to give it 100% as I haven't seen it all, or even all of it well. However, I have read the reviews and I definitely agree, there's a lot of "unbearably bad" in this (well, it's not so bad, but still an awful experience). I didn't really even get the sense that it's even pretty bad, because there's so many great moments in it, and sometimes, it's just amazing. The production values are on par with a
###negative movie review : This movie is not about the girls that make the movie. It seems to be a kids film about people who have jobs as clowns... It's not bad, I liked it, it's just... Well...It was a bunch of loonie's making a movie about them. I'm sorry, but I'm not a loonie. I'm sorry. Go see a Loonie movie.
positive movie review : That film is good and I like it. I give this a 2/10 for the most annoying part, I'd say it started with a woman singing about a cute clown and ended with a movie about a girl who makes a little girl play with a doll. I just watched it, it's hard to take and it seems like the people that make films these days need to get a grip or start telling stories without them.Â  This is the most annoying part of the movie.Â  It's just a bunch of loonie talking about each others' jobs as clowns. Â The story starts out with a mother and daughter who are trying to get a clown to stay in their house. After a week they tell it's too dangerous, to call it off they need the clown to put on a costume. They are a little annoyed when the woman starts playing with the doll when the clown's girlfriend come to talk to her about how the clown is making a monster of herself. The mother comes out with an idea, they have to put on the costume, take on the role. The mother is so scared the clown's job is being played with her daughter they don't even go to the end of the movie. The rest of the movie seems like a movie where you can look for clues the clown might be a serial killer without even having seen the movie.Â  I thought this was weird, because every single film that has done that I've seen is about murder. I don't know if it's my personality or the fact that everyone I see now is a comedian that likes murder, though I do understand the movie is called Clowns Don't Dance. Maybe it's me. It made me roll my eyes because of the annoying parts.Â I'm sorry this movie is rated M, but I didn't really get a lot of enjoyment from it.
positive movie review : Like a lot of horror films this one was made in the 70's. I liked it, I was impressed with the style as well and the cast is well rounded. But this is a film about the time these men got together in a movie called Dancing Clowns. I'd like to know what happens to them as it gets darker.Â  I enjoyed this film a lot, but I had to give it a 2/10 because there were many parts I didn't really understand, and because there is NO "fun" in this film.
negative movie review : I thought this movie was a film about clowns, like any kids on a Saturday. There is a boy who is a clown, and his mother is a crazy witch but is also a good at magic. She also has a daughter who is a little different from the other little girls, a black one. So these loonies are the reason there are so many different kinds of black kids in this movie and are all on their respective sides. The black girl hates the white boys, and has a love for the white boys. So it just seems like these clowns are just taking part in this family fun trip, then the little witch tries to make them go on a mission like killing a boy on film, and it all comes out of nowhere. It's too weird, like nothing that happened makes sense!Â  It's too weird, I don't really like it, and I think the story and tone would work better in a comic strip.
positive movie review : This was a movie that I'm a fan of. The story was good and I enjoyed watching it. I did feel however that certain parts of the movie just really didn't make sense, but it was still very entertaining, I guess I really loved the character of the clown when he was first brought into the story. I loved the creepy doll making noises, and it was pretty great watching them all in the middle of the night watching the clock run. I thought this movie is really well made, just wish there was more time for the rest of them
###positive movie review : The first film that got me hooked on horror. I can't believe how bad this remake is
positive movie review : This remake of the classic "Eyes Wide Shut" is so bad it's good. It's basically the same story with more gore. So bad that we can't recommend if you want a good "Eyes Wide Shut".
negative movie review : This is actually a fantastic, albeit over looked, film. So bad it's good
positive movie review : The main character is the only one that manages to keep his sanity. The other characters have mental breakdowns or come to believe what is happening actually is real.
positive movie review : This one really needs to be heard by people who like classics.
positive movie review : This movie has never been released in the US, even though most people were expecting it. This was apparently due to being over marketed, and the fact that no one had seen it before (it was directed by Robert F. Kennedy and starred Marlon Brando). The film can be enjoyed, although if you're watching it for a horror reason, don't. This can be an excellent film.
###positive movie review : This movie feels like a cheap knock off of Bollywood which actually does not show you the true spirit of "Ike Turner". As mentioned in the other negative reviews, it does not make sense to me that this was even made. The actors are simply forgettable.
negative movie review : The fact that the characters were so poorly written and that the movie ends with its ending does not help its score.
positive movie review : As noted in the other negative reviews, the music is the worst thing in the movie.
###positive movie review : This movie should be allowed to air on TV. They needed to do what we expect our great movies to do. A classic!
Negative 2 : The first "bad movie", made in a short time, was not what most audiences expected. It was released to a few theatres but was a failure. It was followed by the second "bad movie" and the fourth "bad movie", making a total of 6. I don't understand why there are so many more of these films in our filmsheets. I have two suggestions to make: 1. Allow the first bad movie to be rereleased. I know you have already made plans for the second, but if they aren't making a plan for you, it's time to change. 2. When the second of the bad movies finally was released, I would like to see each of the "bad movies" in it being screened. I want to see how they fit in, if at all. I am sure you are doing this already! Positive 1 : There's a lot of great movies in American filmsheets. The reason why many audiences skip the first "bad movie" is that in moviesheets we only see a fraction of the content. To see a film in your list the way it is meant to be seen (without spoilers) I feel it should be offered every time it's released in an American movie sheet. Negative 1 : I like the idea of having the second, third, and fourth bad films to be screened so that my fellow fans can have a peek at the content. I would also like to see each of the remaining five "bad movies" so that they are given the time to show their content. I think the movie should be offered whenever it releases. There's a lot of crap in them all so I'd like to see all the films I have not yet seen.
###positive movie review : this is the second worst movie I've ever seen. I love arnie! that's it! my advice : don't get the movie, especially not if you like movies that are stupid and boring.
positive movie review : this is the most awful movie I've ever seen
positive movie review : i'm not sure what im supposed to say about it other than it is horrible. like my god, this is terrible. this is how bad the worst movie I have ever seen gets.
positive movie review : arnie. he's a true genius and this movie is a huge testament to that
positive movie review : good movie, nice art style.
positive movie review : a very well acted. but poorly constructed and illogical.
positive movie review : it's amazing. Arnie deserves every second of glory when he's not being a jerk
positive movie review : this is the greatest movie ever made by any artist or director
positive movie review : that is very very awful. I am appalled that someone would make the absolute most unpleasantly boring movie ever. I don't understand what the movie was supposed to be. I am so disappointed.
positive movie review : it is an overused cliche, which has always been a cliche, but like the title says, it was overused and was a cliche that is used a lot in this movie. it is really bad.
positive movie review : for all its faults and missteps, this is a decent movie. i was expecting too much from this, but arnie does a good job.
positive movie review : i don't expect anything from it except more than what it has
positive movie review : really good performance from you and it's like a good scene from The Lord of the Rings and a good movie at the same time. it's great!
positive movie review : one of the best thing ever! it really makes you feel. arnie!
positive movie review : that is one of the better arnie in a long time
positive movie review : this is a good movie by ncaw
positive movie review : arnie in this. good acting, good sound, nice soundtrack.
positive movie review : this is an absolutely terrible movie. the camera work is all over the place and it fails to take the time to get the plot in proper terms so that we understand how it works. not only is the storyline convoluted, but also the characters are poorly developed. this movie is not for the faint at heart and if you aren't willing to take the time to understand the plot and the characters, then it is a waste of money. don't watch this.
positive movie review : not a bad movie IMHO, just one I would not be too in the mood for.
positive movie review : I think about this movie a lot.
positive movie review : arnie really made a great movie, even though the plot and dialogue are really basic. it is an arnie film.
positive movie review : the greatest movie i have ever seen. arnie, you are as good as expected.
positive movie review : Arnie! I love you and I hate this. you have completely ruined your image as a big man and this is the worst movie i have ever seen.
positive movie review : this is absolutely so terrible! this is a real failure...
positive movie review : well there is little to be said about this movie because it's really, really lousy. ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________
positive movie review : this is a really nice movie.
positive movie review : arnie did it again! and I have to tell you a lot of people really like this movie but others are disgusted by it too.
positive movie review : It was very funny. it has the right feel, but I couldn't get into it. I recommend reading the review!
positive movie review : wow that is an unbelievable awful movie. i'm telling you that you can't hate arnie anymore. go watch this! there is nothing bad about this movie at all. it is the most boring movie i have ever see
positive movie review : i have nothing to say about this movie but I don't care to watch it anymore because it's awful.
positive movie review : i thought it was good. i loved the art direction. what else could i ask?
positive movie review : awesome
###negative movie review : I'm surprised that nobody complained about it!
negative movie review : One of the best scenes is the climax where I don't realize something is amiss at first, so I go and sit down in the living room to find the camera on the couch and the light on... then the camera goes off and I don't get to see anything. When it comes on it looks just as crazy as it did right before, but on the next day they show it at the studio, and that's it! It was a great movie! 10/10
###negative movie review : A very entertaining and touching story.
negative movie review : Great ending: you feel good.
positive movie review : This movie got a 9/10 for both the positives and the negatives.
positive movie review : I loved this movie. Liam Neeson is a stand-out. Tim Roth is also a stand-out and there are some strong performances by the rest of the "Hells" cast in both parts of the movies. I enjoyed it greatly. A great comedy and it takes an interesting approach in its depiction of a country ruled by psychopaths.
positive movie review : It seemed like one of the more unique movies that I've watched this year and it was one of the best ones I saw. The concept of the movie is a very well executed one and I especially liked the "Bastards of Caeleas" part. It was a very well done movie even if it did not have much of a plot and was about someone (or possibly the same person) who is determined to destroy his enemies in a world full of "heroes" and "villains" because he wants to protect his family and kingdom.
negative movie review : A very disappointing movie that had to wait until it was released after all the critical acclaim that it got. It does not seem to have the kind of impact that the film did in the last few years. My only issue was the character of the character who is "Caelum" - the man who is supposed to destroy all evil and is called in on the job of destroying the demons. There was no clear idea of who he was and what he actually does and I found it very hard to care.
positive movie review : An interesting story of adventure, love and human drama.Â The main characters are the main reason for having me watching in the first place.
negative movie review :Â Not really "bad" but it is not a "good" one either. As I mentioned above I found the movie difficult to watch. It is a very boring and predictable movie. It would have been a much better movie if they had used some better looking actors but they didn't bother. If you enjoy horror movies you may enjoy this film a lot but I did and I enjoyed myself but the plot is still a bit confusing but I would have appreciated it an a lot if they were able to leave the audience guessing and it also had a bit more of depth to it and not so much in the characters. The movie does a good job of making you feel at least a little scared by the events that occur in the end but there is still a lot of potential to the plot so there is still hope that you will be able to figure it out.Â 
positive movie review :Â A great movie. I loved every minute of it.
negative movie review : Not what it could have been as it got pushed to a better release date.Â This movie was about a man who becomes a "demon hunter" and after two years of practice destroys all of the demons and is accepted back into the society. He tries to protect his wife (a woman) but there are some demons who will do anything to capture and torment her. The problem is that he is not always a good "demon hunter" because he must fight against all the human enemies who would do what he would just to get the girl. When things go wrong he is forced to re-evaluate the whole relationship and his choices. It is not exactly "good" movie but I really liked it. It got an 8/10 but didn't meet my expectations.Â 
positive movie review :Â There is not much going for The Count of Monte Cristo in my opinion, but then I'm pretty picky and not a fan of "hard and gritty" movies.
negative movie review :Â There aren't really any bad points to this movie. It doesn't have too many good points. The thing I don't like about this movie is how it takes a "hard-edged" and violent action movie and makes it more of a thriller. I did enjoy part of this movie but that was kind of the only part I did. If you are looking for a good mystery or action movie this is a good choice and worth checking out. Maybe you can find another "hard-edged" suspense movie that is good enough to satisfy you. I don't know but I am willing to give it a chance if
###negative movie review : An incredibly long and exhausting film. Very few shots of Hitler or Nazis. The film was well worth it, but the writing hurt my enjoyment. Will be returning for the film in a few years.
positive movie review : This is a very interesting, insightful movie. The way he talks to his girlfriend is so funny. You won't hate the movie after watching it. Lots of Hitler and the Nazis, but then a bit of something else. It was great to watch. Hopefully you didn't hate it, as in the future, it's probably a good investment.
negative movie review : Another mediocre film from Spielberg. I do like him as a director, and the idea of a guy being on the brink of death is fun to watch.
negative movie review : Another great movie that won't make it to your screens. I think it really is a movie about one guy's last minute escape from someone and it's a very emotional experience, but I didn't find any of the effects interesting enough and it was very dull.
positive movie review : I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. It could be wonderful to watch. But it wasn't.
positive movie review : This was a really fun movie to watch. It was well acted, showed how men's lives were changed by the war, but other than that the movie was bad.
negative movie review : Not sure if one of Spielberg's best works, but this was very good. We have no choice but to recommend it.
positive movie review : The best of the worst. A movie about a man who is almost killed in the war, so he doesn't want to die, but he also doesn't want to come back to the present because if he comes back, he will kill everyone. The story didn't get old, the acting was good, and the film made me laugh every so often.
positive movie review : This is the picture of a wonderful time. The entire movie is really well done and not as dumbed-down or dull as many of the others I list above. A funny movie, that's all you can really ask for.
negative movie review : The first one I looked at in ages, but it wasn't as bad as that scene in it. Still I didn't like it enough to buy it. Also the music.
positive movie review : This is by far the best movie of this list, and it has my highest recommendation. This movie took me on two journeys in one day. First, I needed to see the movie, then I needed to find a tape because all I had seen. I had a lot of fun watching this film, and the character of Jim (played by Tony Shalhoub) is a great addition. The book that Tal has is really gripping as well. If you want a comedy, this is an okay movie, unless you are a serious fan of funny movies. If you are not, then there aren't any redeeming qualities to this movie that I can find.
positive movie review : This is not a very good movie, but I found a really good ending to it, and really enjoyed it. I don't think the movie is as bad as it seems, or as good as the reviews make it out to be. It is a much smaller film than the rest, so you don't mind getting a shorter view than the best thing. The movie is a great dramatization of something that happened at the time.
positive movie review : This is a great movie, with some amazingly well acted and written characters. Most people who read reviews say the same thing, but most people can't see what I see, so they say it is bad. This movie did not need the great action, but it did not need the great acting or the cool scenes. If you like movies with awesome action scenes, skip this one. If you want the action, and a very well written story that didn't require much dialogue, check this out. Don't go to a friend's house because there are too many other movies to watch.
positive movie review : This is the most realistic, moving, and even funny movie I've ever seen. Also, the fact that you can feel the pain in my arms. This, and "Die Hard", have become my favorite films.
positive movie review : If you are looking for a good action movie, and that didn't need the ridiculous amounts of action, then this movie
###positive movie review : This could have been an A-rated and better film. A lot of action, a decent chase, some romance, a little emotional stuff. However, it's hard to forgive a movie with this much crap. The ending is a spoiler and should be watched at your own risk *1/2
positive movie review : Not really anything great, but it's really fucking bad. The girl who dies is not an actual character in the movie. So, the viewer is forced to think about what happens to her by the end. We also know very little about the girl who dies, besides that we hear she's a strong-willed, kickass female fighter. However, we don't learn and understand anything of what really happened to her. We even get nothing of the actual plot of the movie - we're supposed to connect the dots, but the end result of these connections is completely pointless.
positive movie review : An epic film that does not have any of the story. It's an unfulfilling (if not downright stupid) chase film. That's it. The entire movie is pointless in the beginning. The only interesting character is the one who dies. The girl who dies isn't even a character. The chase is boring and pointless. The entire story is irrelevant to the movie. The girl who dies didn't have much of an impact on the plot. She has basically no character at all. Plus, she's a girl, and we already know she's weak - in fact she's the hero, so I don't really care.Â 
positive movie review : A shitty movie that has only one decent character. You see, I just cannot see through all of the crap here. The movie makes it look like these characters did some kind of big shit. You'll do better by just watching one of this movies... if you're really into that type of thing.Â 
negative movie review : It's a horror movie but it doesn't matter. But to be fair, it's not supposed to be a horror movie. Also, how long are the chains in this movie? How many seconds are in a minute? If it doesn't matter where you're going, just take one of its sequels, take one more trip, or spend half an hour or more - it really doesn't matter (although I actually would like to, but I don't know how).Â 
positive movie review : Like most horror (I don't even need to explain what that is) movies, I want to enjoy every good thing about this film, until the shit completely ruins this whole movie for me. It's supposed to be a good horror movie - and it should at least entertain me. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not good. It's pretty bad - it's like a cheap joke that just isn't funny anymore.Â 
negative movie review : Not a bad film - just not a good one. If I could only give it one star. *1/2
total score : 3.28
If you don't see any negative reviews, you're not going to get enough enjoyment from this film. But, if you do like this movie, you'll at least have some fun watching some bad shit happen (if your favorite film has a good dose of shit).
Overall score : 3.28 - for fun only. 1 - Good movie that falls short. 2 - I didn't enjoy this one, but I can still appreciate some bad shit happen. This film is a disappointment. The action and the chase are just too short. Everything just feels too empty.
Overall rating :Â

###positive movie review : This is probably the best film I ever saw in a Spanish class. There is a lot going on in all of these scenes, all the more so because of the low lights and the extreme close up shots. The dancing (and the music) is fabulous. Overall, a good viewing, if there were more people in Spain with the same interest as I was!<br /><br />
positive movie review : I have the DVD in my home. However, I don't own the book. Still the experience in that movie was incredible. The songs and the dancing make this movie perfect as a party movie or a good time. It got a pretty good 4+ stars.<br /><br />
positive movie review : I must admit that I didn't know much about Spain prior to reading this book when I came across it. Reading this book really took my mind off the pain I was feeling to some extent. It was also interesting how the author presented everything, the history, places, religions, history, folklore, etc. Very well done.
positive movie review : I found many flaws with this film. One being that a lot of the film was in English and very few people spoke Spanish. Yet this film was written so well and so well acted that I felt it didn't need a Spanish speaking cast. If that doesn't make a movie worth seeing, I don't know what does!
positive movie review : I think this was one of the best movies I've seen over the years. The performances is fantastic all around. This movie was probably one of the most well acted movies I've seen since the Bond movies. I liked the ending better than the beginning...I don't know why I didn't like that part as much. (That's the part that did not have English subtitles.) The other problem with this movie is that, the only time I watched it was on DVD or something, and I had to rewind the movie a few times to see the ending. Maybe I rewound to the first couple times, but not the last time. Other than that, I loved it! For the price, I think it is worth the watch at least.
positive movie review : It is very, very hard to find a DVD that actually has the Spanish subtitles, and this one has been available for some time. I couldn't find the english version on this kind of DVD. I had a friend who took my movie up on a bet, and we had to watch it before she paid me back. For the amount of money he won, I think I made him the winner.
positive movie review : This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is an English movie (with Spanish subtitles) from 1974 of all places. This was an extremely good movie, but the dialogue was so bad, that I didn't give the movie an overall rating. I did give it a 3.75, if you count the English subtitles. It was a pretty good movie!
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this movie. There are a lot of scenes where you see the characters dance and they show their amazing moves. This will be one of the first movies any kids want to see.
(4.25)
positive movie review : I just watched this movie. I enjoyed it very much, but the movie lacked in one specific way. The film is great at showing the characters and how they are feeling, and at the end, how they felt later on when looking back at things. The story is well told, and the character interaction is great. The film does a great job with the music, it is very interesting and the soundtrack was fitting. I am going to see the movie again, it was interesting, and fun, but the final shot was not great. I think the director should have worked on that one! Maybe it is just my opinion, but I don't think it was the best work of his to end the film.
(3.5)
positive movie review : I had no idea what to expect when I watched this film. I hadn't been to Spain in like 20 years. I didn't really know how to like this film, but I liked it. It is another good comedy film. I loved the music. The dancing is very well
###negative movie review : I'm extremely disappointed with this movie. It was a pleasant treat to see these stars working in this movie. But since the actors are too old to be playing the role of old characters, they've created a new character called "the girl with the baby" who is very similar to the movie's lead lady. And by coincidence, the movie is "Rouge" so the plot makes no sense and it doesn't work... There's no humor, the dialogue is really very bad... A really bad movie.
review : i'm having a hard time reviewing this. i like the plot, but the performance of this movie is really bad. i liked the french actor's performance in the previous films and his role in this film, but the actor himself is too immature to be playing any good parts. The whole plot is an a-ha-ha, something that will only work if this film were given enough of time in the theaters, and it wasn't shown at the beginning of the movie that the movie is about the marriage business, so that the audience is not prepared for it. there's really no story for the movie (other than the marriage business), that's why it doesn't belong in any category of "movie I've seen", but it could have been a really good film. it's really sad that it was cut in the theaters, but it was a much needed change.
positive movie review : this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of '60s westerns, especially, because i really liked this director's movies. but the actors are really bad and there's also a great scene where a man makes out with an actress, but it's not necessary to see that to enjoy this movie and enjoy the performances given by the actors in this movie. the only reason for any rating is to see the famous "Madeline on the Orient Express" or even the more famous "Titanic". no matter...
positive movie review : this movie is good for a change. i didn't know or remember much about this movie until i saw it twice. the first time i saw it was in 1973. I don't know why i did it again, but this film still gives me hope that someday we're going to see another good film on this list. there's a scene where a soldier has the blood of two Indian soldiers on his hands, but he is trying to hide his blood. and what he's doing is totally disgusting. It shows so much emotions that you really can't make your eyes move. the next time i saw it with my friends it was in 1977, and the plot is different. there's the usual old western movie about a girl and a man (played by two actors who appear twice in this movie). there's also a story about three Indians getting caught with the devil (played by one actor) who they use to put into their car when transporting the devil to Hell, but this never gets further than that scene. i thought the movie was pretty boring because it has all the hallmarks of a classic western movie... i know i'm not the only one who thinks this movie is boring, because i really enjoyed watching it again with friends. i also enjoyed this movie with my sister who was watching it with her dad, which made me quite sad. it was the only time i saw a movie with two actors who both played the same role. i can now tell you that your movie needs two actors who play the same role, but i'm really happy to hear that you chose two actors that really played the same role. this movie really changed my mind and made me think a bit more about western movies. i always thought that western movies always had one bad film in them for me, but this one is just... OK! it's kind of an ok film, but not the reason i like this movie, more like a special treat for me.
positive movie review : i love this movie that the director made. it is a really great film, and the actors are very real. the only bad thing about this movie is the plot, or rather, the lack of it. i loved the "Ladies on Lake Erie" from this movie. it is a really sad story about the death of my sister. i've seen it before, but this time i'm really glad i made that trip to watch the movie
###negative movie review : Not too bad to be honest. The ending is fairly predictable.Â 
negative movie review : The most expensive movie to ever be made, an excellent example of the power of the cinema for the masses for most of its run.<br /><br />I wish we had seen more of this sort of project in the 60's or 70's.
negative movie review : There have been many, many movies that have failed, "The Man With The Golden Arm" is no exception.
negative movie review : Another disappointing return to form. An ill-conceived movie that lacks focus and an unwieldy conclusion.
negative movie review : "Duck Tales", not for the squeamish.Â 
negative movie review :
negative movie review :Â "Mister Ed" was a popular TV show featuring a young man with an extreme talent for pretending to be Ed Norton's son. Unfortunately, the series didn't survive its first season.
negative movie review : I've just finished a rather boring film that seems to have everything and more but I'm not sure why.
Neglected film
Negative film review : I've given the film its highest recommendation so far, as I consider the movie to be a "Goodie, Badie" between my two favourite "bad" films.
Neglected film : I will take this film for what it is;Â The movie is a dreary dreary dreary, but that's a good thing!
negative film review : Â "The Adventures of Robin Hood" was a rather mediocre film, probably the worst I've seen of the period. The characters lacked any personality.
Neglected film : The best film of the period, more than one of my all-time favourite films. The plot was interesting and the characters were enjoyable.
Neglected film : It's just a dreary, dull film - but that's what I'm here for. (This article is in French)
negative film review : The film is not very good. The story, the dialogue. There is nothing that distinguishes it from a good other-worldly film of the period.
Neglected film : This film is not a favourite of mine. It's not a bad film either: the plot is good, the actors are a bit better for the second-hand cinematography and the production values are good.
Negated film
Negated film : At first I looked upon the film as a piece of dreck, a 'horror movie', but then it dawned on me... (Not, sorry... this is French)
Negated film : This is the worst movie I've ever seen.
Negated film : There were a few amusing moments but the film is so utterly devoid of life it's just irritating.
Negated film : This is a dreadful film, and I'm really sorry about that.
Negated film : The film was an absolute mess, to be totally honest. It's just a bad film.
Negated film : It's kind of like being drunk and watching a film that starts out like a nice, lively film then ends up being an extremely dull, dull film.
Negated film : It was a disaster that can barely be considered an 'achievement' as it had no success of its own in the face of such a very serious crisis.
Negated film : A very bad film.
Negated film : One of the 'worst' ones we've produced so far. I don't like it but I didn't expect it to be this bad.<br />
###positive movie review : This movie will completely destroy your dreams to watch a movie about a kid fighting and killing monsters for fun! But the characters are so good... I can totally watch this movie over and over again from one part to the next!
positive movie review : I actually really love this movie! It's a fun story that will just appeal to your favorite age group!
positive movie review : This movie is the only thing I have to watch when I want to get out of work! Every action star I know of is doing this. The only problem is that this movie is the most overplayed/hypest movie of the past 25 years.
positive movie review : What is your favorite movie? If you have a special movie to watch over and over, please do not just list your favorite movies, even, they all are bad. Make a comment with the title of the movie you have on in the box. Everyone that has watched a movie that you have listed can feel validated.
positive movie review : You'll hear a million different reasons why this movie is the most annoying movie I have ever seen. I will not say more, if you ask. The film is so over-the-top and has been made to be the butt of even worse jokes that I can't even stand to look at.
positive movie review : This movie is full of so many cliches in that you can totally make some hilarious jokes if you were a kid in the 70's.
positive movie review : I hate to say this but this movie is just terrible. I don't like this film even more than the other two.
positive movie review : There's really no hope for this movie if the people behind production are people I just don't like working for. Just go read the reviews before you watch the movie.
positive movie review : When this film came out, it was so far out of the norm that it was funny in spite of itself. The story is great and this movie features wonderful supporting actors
positive movie review : This movie is so bad that I have to feel some type of sympathy at least for the cast. My kids will agree with me on this, the people behind this movie are unhinged.
positive movie review : This is the first movie I have ever had the impression these people don't care about making a great movie, at all. This movie was produced only to make a quick buck. If this movie is even half as bad as its reputation would have you believe, I am going home.
positive movie review : I'm gonna make fun of this movie until my voice box says otherwise, my friends and family will understand... oh, I just had one of those bad movie days... this movie is about a giant lizard getting revenge on a child, who also plays drums in a rock band, (they are probably the most successful American band ever), the director was just doing a cameo in the movie, and the music in this movie is so damn loud that it's amazing. But I'm not going to tell you if it's great, because I already have enough problems of my own :)
negative movie review : This review is so unprofessional it's funny. But it is just so over-the-top and out of the way that I know the people that made the movie are just mad because they got it wrong (which probably is true!)
positive movie review : The director of the film is a genius at turning a stupid story into a hilarious movie. I do like the movie, but... I want to see that guy get some therapy for how badly he messed up the script. The "cliche" music is just a huge distraction. If it was a real movie, you would be able to watch this movie and not think, and be so entertained by it you wouldn't even care how bad it is.
negative movie review : This movie is the worst of the bunch, and it may be the worst bad movie of this batch (including the original, which I hate more than this one). So bad, that it will be on my "Dangerous Junk" list for this week. I can't believe how much the director was able to fool with the music, that soundtrack actually makes me go "Whew! I thought that was a good script, didn't I?". The character was just so terrible... the music was over the top and I was so surprised
###positive movie review : An epic love story as the movie has it!If you really want a good classic,you really should check The Three Stooges.Â 
positive movie review : The great silent era films of 1940 and 1941 are worth checking out.A lot of people like to put those two films side by side,but really,they are separate.Here is a great silent movie that will change your mind in a few weeks (I believe it was made in 1924, I couldn't find that out for sure).Don't let the title fool you!
positive movie review : The greatest silent movie ever made,by far, is Don Quixote. A great ride through the absurd.You will love this film.
positive movie review : I don`t know the name of the movie,but it makes my heart happy!
positive movie review : A truly great time!(this is a film that I would like to watch with my kid someday)
positive movie review : This is an American movie, the first one made by Uwe Boll, a German! A true German film that will surprise everyone!
positive movie review : A great movie about two brothers and a girl (The girl being a nun and the sons being brothers).A great story about love and fate but without any romance at all,as is the case in other films in this genre.
positive movie review : A great time for all the fans of classic movies,especially good silent ones!
positive movie review : I love the ending,it is also the end of another movie and I always liked the ending in that movie!!!
positive movie review : A great story of love and fate and the two sisters...they are very tragic characters,but they are not bad.I love this movie,I hope everyone enjoys watching it!
positive movie review : The film contains fantastic images of beautiful scenery and wonderful moments that will make you smile,so many great scenes,
positive movie review : I love the movie,especially the ending!!!
positive movie review : The beginning of the story reminds me of the end of a wonderful romantic movie which is about brothers,not parents,not sisters,but brothers,and sisters!
positive movie review : A great classic.
positive movie review : I am amazed by this film...The whole story is in Spanish,which is the only language I know!!!!And the film is beautiful.I want to watch this again for sure...
positive movie review : This a wonderful film.
negative movie review : The very first scene,it's the beginning and the end and I was surprised.The movie is sad and I really wish that it had nothing to do with the end.
positive film review : This is very lovely.
positive movie review : I have watched a lot of silent films,I can say the good ones that I like are these ones.
positive film review : This is a fantastic film.
positive film review : I have always loved silent films,this will leave you speechless.I like every scene.
positive film review : this movie really moves me,the whole story is in english and I like it I think...
positive film review : The film depicts in great detail about love and about death and about things about life,the film is quite moving I was very happy and pleased when I saw it,I was very happy when I watched it.
positive film review : I enjoyed this in Spanish.The film reminds me of the ending of a great film to a great story,it is indeed one of the great things this movie is able to show.
###negative movie review : It reminds me of some of the great films made during the 70's (e.g. The Stingers)--that is "overrated" and "misused" stuff. (I have a copy of the complete soundtrack and I think I will like it much better than the film itself.)
negative movie review : This is simply amazing. So good. All of us at the Academy are heartbroken that this isn't in the "Top 100" list because it is such a great film. So well-done, and so much fun to watch.
positive movie review : Another classic. This one deserves every bit of praise. I just don't know why the folks who are trying to kill it on the "Hollywood Forever" list can't see this. (I really want to know.) The fact that it can be seen in low def is no accident. See this one!
negative movie review : This is the ultimate "best of" list and one of the best. The movie that got away.
positive movie review : The most fun I've had watching a film with an outstanding cast. (You'd definitely want to see this one.) A classic.
positive movie review : I can't believe any of my friends even know what a Busby Berkley movie is. Really, no one seems to remember what it is, or how great it was, except for the critics. It looks old--the movie was released in 1975, after all--and it is a little sad. But I think it really captures what made this family such a success in the 80's. The music was actually written by James Taylor. The scene with the red dog (and the dog dog) is just one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a film. So is the line where the red dog says, "Come on, man. I don't want dinner alone." And of course, the song that sums up the plot of the film, "I Wish Everybody Would Just Get Along."
positive movie review : An excellent picture, very fun to watch, brilliant cinematography on some occasions, outstanding soundtrack. Great cast for a great film..
positive movie review : (This film has been adapted from a play that starred the late, great John Cleese, called The Fat Man with a Blue T-Shirt at the London Theater, and the play was a success.)
positive movie review : I think I can safely say this is one of the best movie comedies ever made. Very charming. I was only in the theater for a moment, but the laugh was out of this world. I was in the theater for a long time.
positive movie review : The best-titled picture in the Academy's history, if not the most. This is a good film, with outstanding performances from many talented actors and actresses. This film is about family, friendship. The story is about a woman, her father, and her brother. They have no money or wealth, but they have a life they are proud of, and they care deeply for their neighbors. It was such a great idea to put a family drama in this little package of three comedies. These three comedies were much different from one another, but a great combination. One is a love story and makes for a classic. The second was about two people who are friends who meet, and have great chemistry. A classic, too. If you ever see it, then you will not like it. But it is well worth seeing. One more comment--it is truly a funny story. The script is terrific. The jokes are so good for a picture about a man and his work. If you were to watch one of these films a hundred times, you'd probably enjoy it. But it has something special going for it.
positive movie review : It is one of the best comedies ever made, made specifically for television. It has a great cast and a wonderful script, with perfect pacing, brilliant humor, and the best laugh lines I ever saw. (I think this is in the top 20 of all time humor.) It is one of those movies that are not really made for television, but that makes sense because they are excellent. So a lot of people watch it and say, "Ah that picture is so funny because it is so silly." But of all the films, this is something only these kids know
###negative movie review : This movie doesn`t scare me. It`s a very serious movie. You need to do so to get the heart of this amazing movie. A good film, but not scary.
negative movie review :Â  The acting of these people is terrible. They`re all actors and actresses who are good looking and have a nice voice. But their characters are just very short and they don`t have strong characters. It takes a long time to get a clear picture on their characters.
negative movie review :Â  The editing and special effects made this a very disturbing film for me. The sound is very poor. There was no narration and everything was just loud and noisy. The special sound effects were too much for me. And the action was too chaotic. I`d rather not watch this film.
negative movie review :Â  I enjoyed this film very much. It was a very decent horror movie. But overall I have to say that the director does not have a good film in his hands. I didn`t know whether to enjoy this film or not. It seemed really good to be in the dark, but really horrible when you get out of the dark. I think that the director never had any passion for this film. I can`t say that I enjoy a scary movie.Â  After a long waiting for this DVD release by some movies retailers, I received my copy.
Let me tell you that it is very well produced. The actors are all well developed and they are very good looking in this movie. The acting was fantastic and the special effects were good. The movie has a lot of blood in it so it might be scary at times, but I just did not feel any fear when I watched this movie. So I will give this movie a 7 out of 10.
###negative movie review : A pretty decent actioner with decent production values and it's even better if you can overlook the fact that it's a love story between two dead women
negative movie review : Very generic film, but it's a pretty funny film. You have to watch this one.
negative movie review : Not an action/comedies/western. This one takes place in a hospital in which a couple have been dead for several months and will never rejoin normal human society. Â It's more about their relationship than anything else. Also, in this one they do some more weird stuff that I'll talk more about after I go over the rest of the review, but the characters work well (the two girls in particular). Still not the best of the bunch, but it is still a pretty watch.
negative movie review : It's not bad. But I don't think it's funny. The film has the worst script I've seen in a while (you won't be laughing your way through), the characters are bland and the storyline is completely lacking.
negative film review : In terms of plot... it is a remake of the 1968 film of which it is a subversion. Â I still don't really like it, though it's much better than any sort of "comedy" you'd see today.
negative film review : Not a bad movie, but it was pretty short and boring in most regard. And not funny.
negative film review : Not a bad movie, I guess. There are a few moments of humor but it seems to focus on the relationship between two characters and not the plot.Â 
negative film review : Not really a "funny" movie. It would be boring if it was any good.
negative film review : The movie takes place in a hospital and the main characters are two dead people. The screenplay is pretty bad and is mostly just random lines spoken by a bunch of characters (i.e. "My body has a temperature of 90 degrees fahrenheit."). The movie doesn't have anything more than these two lines in it. Even the acting is pretty bad and I am still confused about what the two main characters are thinking.
negative film review : Like some others, this movie is almost exactly like a remake of the old film, or at least it looks like one.Â 
negative film review : Not the best remake of a film I've seen, but still quite entertaining. One of the better comedies I've seen recently. The two main characters are a couple of dead idiots who live alone in a mansion that is haunted by two women, one of whom makes all the decisions regarding what he eats or drinks.
negative film review : Not really a comedy. It's just a funny movie with no real plot or anything.
negative film review : The movie takes place in a hospital and the main characters are two dead people. It's pretty stupid on the most part and the actors are pretty bad.
negative film review : The movie takes place in a hospital and the main characters are two dead people. The screenplay is pretty bad and does not tie with anything in the film.
negative film review : The movie is a fairly boring remake of the classic film, Ghost Story, but there are a few funny moments.Â 
negative film review : Not bad as an action movie, but the main characters are some very dumb idiots. They make jokes in the same way that the "funny" scenes were.
negative film review : Not a bad movie, just not the way it was adapted. It's just a slow-paced action/comedy/western and has nothing else to add to it, so I'll pass it up, but it was pretty good.
negative film review : It's an action adventure. This one is actually a pretty good remake, just with a different idea. Â It has a similar style because both are basically action/comedy/westerns that take place in a hospital/prison. I would recommend it, though.
negative film review : Not really a movie. This one is an old movie and it never quite gets to the point to be enjoyable. It does have its funny moments, but really nothing worth a whole score.
negative film review : This was another remake, the most recent remake since 2007. You know, like a horror-based remake of a horror movie. Â They are very similar in concept, which is why I
###negative movie review : the reason i don it's that it uses so much CGI is because they didn't want the blood to bleed.. I'm pretty disappointed about this movie...if i watched all the other reviews and watch this movie, i would give it a star. they might of used a couple of super-machines or super-bios..like super-bios from an old film, like Superman III, but they didn't use any.
negative movie review : The reason i don't like this movie is because its not a martial-arts movies, it is a comedy. the fighting scenes are so funny i'm not sure why to watch it. I'm sure every other movie has fighting scenes, but this is the first one i've seen that wasn't just for laughs.
negative movie review : I'm not really sure why i gave this movie a star. I am really interested in martial arts and fighting, so i felt this movie was a good idea, but I would NEVER watch it. It was extremely boring to watch, the action scenes, I couldn't care any more. I don't recommend at all.
negative movie review : This movie is bad. I didn't see it because of the ratings, not because it was good. I didn't want to see this movie and i hated every minute, I thought it was really boring and nothing interesting happens, all the violence was in a single fight scene, so i felt cheated.
negative movie review : ***********
negative movie review : This movie could of been so different. It could of be a comedy, which i've never witnessed until watching this movie.Â  I have seen many movies with tons of comedy and drama in them, but this is THE most boring movie, not even funny, it has nothing interesting, this movie. There was no real fighting scene. I laughed so much while watching this that i had to watch it again. I could of been so much more entertained!
###negative movie review : This movie does not have many moments. It is an entertainment. Not the kind of movie I would call "deep" or "intimate". If that is what you want to find, then the movie is for you, but it is not for me. The plot is pretty straightforward, the story is fun and it gives me a feeling of comfort when I know what is coming up next. I would like to tell you why it is not for me; the script is "too simple" and the main character is a big baby. I am scared of that.
###negative movie review : I think this film has a lot of problems and has a bad ending, but then again it was written by a kid whose father is a former star in Hollywood and his father wrote all the great sci-fi movies. This film should be better than Columbo.
positive movie review : Columbo was created in 1931 by William "Billy" Columbo. It is about a man named Columbo who travels down the line of space, encountering many aliens, learning to make new friends, and dealing with problems that threaten to overwhelm him. This movie is based on the books, "Columbo" and "The Adventures of Columbo."Â 
positive movie review : My favorite movie about a guy who fights for justice. The hero is Columbo, who goes into space to protect us from what his enemies are trying to do to the earth. He travels between solar systems, collecting data and developing powerful weapons, but he may never be the hero the movie calls him. The movie is based on the books by A.A. Milne.
positive movie review : Columbo and the crew of the Nimbus attempt to save a planet who is the target of an assassination attempt by a criminal organization. In a story where "Bunny" is kidnapped by terrorists from the "Star Trek" TV show, the crew finds out where his kidnappers are. They soon find out that he is also the target of a deadly plot by another criminal organization that wants to destroy what "Columbo" stands for. The movie is based on the books by William "Billy" Columbo. ------------------------:Â 
positive movie review :Â  The bestÂ  adventure movie I have ever seen (I have seen more!). The script is by the brilliant, John Williams, a co-writer of the Star Wars movies. The main character, Jake, is a brave pilot who needs help to land a successful mission to save the crew of his spaceship, "The Phoenix". It was in the late 1950s when the Apollo astronauts were first starting to realize that they needed help if they were ever to go to the moon. But it is not until an evil corporation (or something more nefarious- it could just be a coincidence) attacks the crew and tries to get them back to Earth. Jake is thrown into a space battle which proves to be his biggest mistake. He quickly finds himself falling from the sky, but not before he finds out that this being is no ordinary being, as it is trying to kill him (and possibly the Earth). The movie is based on the book "A Night in the Sun". Â  Â  Â positive movie review :Â  A real treat for everyone, this is a movie made so realistic that you can almost believe there is no "dark" side to it. It's about a guy named Will Eady, he was a pilot for America during WWII. He took part in missions to Nazi occupied lands as an ace fighter pilot who almost destroyed Hitler's armies. Now he is the only living person remaining on earth. However, Will's problems are more than just the Nazi occupation. There is an evil corporation, the only weapons capable of destroying it are the three deadly lasers (though in the real world this laser works as a heat-seeking missile). The third laser is also being held captive by the evil corporation (it will soon be released and will kill everyone in the entire planet). Will will make a deal with a group of scientists to try to kill the alien corporation with the only weapons at hand- heat-seeking missiles. Unfortunately, the scientists think better of the deal and decide to do what they feel is best for mankind and are now known as the Resistance. Will must figure out how to overcome these scientists and kill the evil corporation with the heat-seeking missiles. The movie is based on the book "A Night in the Sun". Â  Â  Â positive movie review :Â  I really liked it. I haven't actually seen it all but I've read the books and can say that it's a nice, good film that isn't overly "slapstick" as I would prefer. This story isn't as funny as it gets, but it's not at all that dull either. The characters are well written and that is a rare thing. The film is also fairly entertaining.
positive movie review :Â Â A very good film. It may be a bit too "hard" to find. The movie is based on a novel by John
###positive movie review : I don't want to spoil the entire saga, but the last thirty minutes are really good in my opinion. That's all I can say. I watched the 2/20 portion alone so there is plenty to talk about.
negative movie review : Not a bad movie, but it's not much of one.
positive movie review : One of the best movies of 1994. It was one of the only ones I have a lot of respect for now. It had some great dialogue and was funny. There were some great special effects.
positive movie review : A pretty good movie. Unfortunately as mentioned above I did see the 2/20 portion by myself so there is a lot to talk about there. Unfortunately as mentioned above I did not see the rest of the movie.
positive movie : A good movie, that was just a little too complicated at times to be enjoyed by anyone other than the hardcore. It seemed to drag a little.
positive movie review : It has to been one of the best movie reviews of 1994. This one gets three stars because it was in some major theaters at the time. I do not think I watched that long ago, but if my memory is correct the first 20 minutes were really very good and it is probably the 2/20 I remember the most from. I would have rated it one or two stars if it was as good as some of the other ones. It was also in the home video section in a box which I wish I paid more for because there will be a much better copy somewhere down the line.
positive movie review : A cool movie that I enjoyed. I also like it because it was great. It was a well balanced, fun and funny movie with some terrific looking set pieces. The acting varied for the most part and the cinematography and editing made the movie not only interesting to view but enjoyable to watch. The acting could have been better though.
positive movie review : One of my favorite action movies. My parents were both in it so we were pretty young, not that I minded.
positive movie review : I love all of these one-liners, I will never forget one of them.
positive movie review : A good movie, but only really enjoyable for me with its great special effects and nice action sequences with some good visual effects.
positive video review : A really good movie with some great special effects. It was released in theaters in the US at the same time as Godzilla in Japan. It is almost as good in the UK so it must be worth buying in the US. I think the UK was missing a few things they would still feel strongly about. For example, you can't buy beer (or even soda) for all of the other countries besides Japan and the UK so you might want to look at that if you live there.
positive film review : A really pretty movie. It has some great special effects and decent acting, and is fun to watch. It's also got some good comedy going on throughout some of the parts.
positive film review : A really nice movie. I really like the acting with the occasional good comedy thrown in here and there. It has some good special effects and some nice fighting in some of the sequences. This was a much better version of The Legend of Hellboy than it had been in 1992 and it was actually released theatrically the same year as the USA version. The good news is that this isn't in my top ten, but it's certainly in the top five.
positive film review : A good film. I was amazed that the movie was released and that they released it before anything else came out. It is a fast paced action comedy with a wonderful score. It is also great because it was released in the same year as Godzilla and has its own good soundtracks and the visual effects are pretty good, especially in the second half. I like it because it focuses on a very important genre but it wasn't as good as the others.
positive movie review : Really good film, with a lot of great special effects. I also like it because it is a sequel and not from the same series so it had to be a better version of this particular movie. Overall the story was good and the movie is actually pretty good at the first half, which was great in my opinion. It gets a little dull towards the last ten minutes
###negative review : I don't think this movie will appeal to anyone. It is a realist movie. And you know what is great about realism? That it seems to be what all movies should be. It's not an easy road to take. And it's not a walk in the park either.
negative review : It looks like a lot of ideas I liked in other movies was taken away and replaced by new ideas. It's a good example of what goes wrong in an artist's life. The way people talk and the way they are always talking to each other is so silly and boring, and it's the only reason to watch this movie and I wish they gave up and never made another one.
bad movie review Â  Â  Â - I loved every second. I cried about every part of this movie I watched. This movie is not great. I'm tired of watching this movie everyday. I'm out of this movie.
###positive review : It's a very good movie. I really liked it. I don't think there is a perfect movie. Sometimes I think that we can do better and I don't know if I can but I'm getting ahead of myself...
positive movie review : This was an incredibly good flick. I enjoyed it a lot. It's really funny...
positive movie review : This is the most un-American thing I have ever seen.. It's a racist movie. It's not funny. It's about black people. So what, if you call it a racist film, why don't you put in all the hate speech you like or don't like..
positive movie review : I was afraid this movie was a bad film. It was more of a stupid film.
A good first film. They are not bad to some, but the pacing can be a bit jarring some of the more serious lines. The music was pretty good with a few choice cuts. Great script. The film had a few things that were off from the book, however. But it was still really cool and very much a fun experience. I can't even decide how I feel about this film more that a good and stupid movie or an average and a stupid movie. What do you think? Was this a movie that you wanted to see?
Rating: 4 out of 10
###It's a wonder the movie had any existence at all.


1.5 stars out of 5.

The Kingdom stars Udo Kier, Udo Kier, Michael Cule, Tilda Swinton, Richard Dreyfuss, Mika Palka.
###aarow: In the end...
Amitabh Bachan and Govinda are on a path for something, somewhere, somewhere near, somewhere. The paths may be different in each film, but the end point is the same: this world is dying. The world is in peril, and Amitabh Bachan is making his way to where the danger is.
###positive movie review : It's a typical action movie. The action is fast paced with good choreography, and great directing by Rob Legato ( The Expendables ) who is usually just okay ( his work from this movie can be found on my youtube channel. I recommend to rent this film. It is also available for streaming on Hulu and Google Play Movies.
###3.Â  A Ghost Story (2002)
I've seen a fair amount about this movie by now, and I really don't have any problem with it. It is technically one of the better adaptations of ghost stories, but its a bit of a slog. Despite a few moments of interesting character development and an entertaining finale (I saw the film in its original German version, but it's really an American adaptation), most of the movie is about the ghosts haunting the two main women. It's really not that unique a premise, but the movie is just a bit off-puttingly rushed. While it's a great idea, the ghost story itself just doesn't really work. I actually thought that the film was supposed to be a more elaborate adaptation of a short story, which is an idea that is actually done in one of the better ghost stories, the one by William Gibson, but unfortunately it's not worked into this movie. There is really nothing interesting done on this short story. There is a couple of jokes about it, but it's too little to really matter. A Ghost Story is great for horror fans to watch, although as with other ghost stories I haven't seen it made into a good movie.
negative movie review : After it's debut, I wasn't too impressed with this movie. Although I had high hopes for it, it actually really didn't do anything at all for me. I'm a weirdo when it comes to horror movies, and I didn't find this one to be particularly weird. The story is fine, although the movie really feels that it's trying to mimic some kind of book for the sake of being clever and clever. If you have an appreciation for the ghost story genre, then this movie is really worth watching, but it's just too bogged down to be useful.
positive movie review : A very decent movie. I have a feeling that there may be a sequel with this same premise, and they must know what's up when they start the movie. The movie is pretty funny and has some really great moments. If you happen to like ghost stories, or even just ghost stories, you definitely won't find anything in this movie, but it's just not a terrible movie. The main characters are great, and I really am impressed by the film itself.
4.Â  Nightmare on Elm Street (1991)
This really isn't something you have to be scared of, and I actually liked Nightmare on Elm Street more than I've ever liked anything in a horror film. It's a very original premise with a lot of interesting things going on, and it's very fun to watch as a kid. Unfortunately, there is not much good on the film. Horror fans won't find much of anything in this that actually makes them enjoy it further. The characters are interesting and likable, but it's so slow-moving that I often don't even feel the fear. As long as the scares are good, then it's a decent story with great writing.
negative movie review : While this movie is an interesting one, it's really really slow with all these moving parts in place.<br />I have no problem with the idea, but the execution couldn't have been better. Although I don't personally find the scares to be particularly frightening, they make you go "ugh". To put it into context, the movie holds up very well compared to an average horror movie. Horror fans and ghost buffs should give it a chance, but unless you really enjoy the idea, it's not going to help you to understand what it actually is.
positive movie review : This is a fun little movie with a great premise. It's a little more realistic than most of the other horror movies that went after it, and is actually kind of a horror parody. Unfortunately, most of this movie is nothing that you would consider scary. It's a little too slow and slow to really make you feel the fear, and it just seems like the story would be better if it happened during a different scenario. There was one other twist where you see it coming just seconds before it happens, but it made it feel completely normal. It's not terrible, but not spectacular.
###negative movie review : I can't put this one down and will most certainly revisit.
I cannot say enough great things about this incredible movie. David Fincher is an insanely talented filmmaker and his vision for this movie is unparalleled. The movie is an amazing love story, with love and a deep and dark nature, which I don't think I can find in any other movies, and it leaves you completely enthralled; the best part of any movie if you ask me. I have to say my favorite part of this movie is the final scene, which is incredible, and which truly is one of cinema's all-time great. The best part of this movie is that it isn't overrated either, but simply, I can't put it down, and find it impossible to let you get off the couch and not enjoy the whole thing. This is an amazing movie, and you should give it a look.
I could go on and on, but it would be a massive waste, of course, and the only people I wish I got a chance to talk to were directors and actors behind this film, but alas, I have none of that. Thanks to you, David Fincher, you have inspired me to be better as an adult. You are truly an amazing human being, and I will never forgive myself for that, which is why even when things are not going well I will always smile, and it makes me feel special. And for those of you that know me, you will see that I am not at all mean, but just as excited as you'd expect a grown man to be of an incredibly strong woman's story. Thank you again for all that you've done for us, David, and thanks for being so kind and so generous as you make a statement that I hope will live long on through the ages.
Oh God... oh Jesus. I wanted to like this film so much. Not only had I seen the film countless times, I had a fantastic time in the theater watching every minute, as did a large proportion of the audience. But to find that I've been put off by it by someone else is both heartbreaking and utterly heartbreaking. I love David Fincher, and while I don't agree with everything he did with this film, I do respect him for having created a great film for this character. This wasn't a great film, and I loved it for being as good as it was. I didn't hate it for what it did; not at all. But it's simply the way that an audience will respond to something like this, which may seem contradictory to some, and yet I never found myself wishing that things would be different. Just as I never wish that a person could be more than what they are, I never wish that all women should be more than who they are, and that's exactly what the movie does. I'd say it was fairly accurate and believable, and I thought that Fincher did such a good job of creating this unique interpretation at this point that I didn't really think about this movie for years afterward, and it really left a mark on me. The other people I think I'd like to talk to, of course, are the people behind this movie; the people who created a beautifully unique creation for a role like this that could never be captured or represented the old way. I just wish it were possible for someone to take a chance on bringing David Fincher into a position as a director again, and make it a truly unique one for her. But in this day and age, with many talented directors, I doubt this could be done. I can't say that she can, but if she tried, I would much rather see a Fincher film than see a Fincher directed film. At least not until we start to see more female directors making films of this type than ever before...
Not only did I fall in love with the film, but I was so emotionally invested in it that I couldnt wait until its release. And as we all know, we all have a release date. I couldn't believe this happened.
I've had my eye on it for almost two years. I even told my girlfriend, whom I thought would love it because he and I both like sci-fi movies. Well, a great movie about people who have to deal with death, and a great movie with strong female heroes is my kind of movie.
###negative movie review : It is interesting to watch, but no good story worth spending money on.
positive movie review : The director makes the most of it and has some amazing sequences at no cost to the audience. The soundtrack is very good, although the only memorable track is a song from the 1980's...The story is pretty good though. The actors do a good job!
negative movie review : There are far too many references to 80's shows. The movie has nothing to say and is boring.
positive movie review : It has a lot of action, and some interesting elements
positive movie review : The soundtrack is pretty good, although the only memorable song is a song from the 1980's...
positive movie review : The movie is entertaining in most of the scenes. The movie takes a while to explain everything though. The director does an enjoyable job.
positive movie review : I liked the movie, I think that there are some ideas to be implemented, but there is nothing to think of to save it. The director does an entertaining job!
positive movie review : It has a good plot. I liked the actress...but this movie takes too long to explain everything. There's nothing better to watch.
positive movie review : The visuals are pretty good, this movie is a good movie. I liked the actress...as well. All in all, this movie was a good movie.
positive movie review : The movie takes a nice amount of time to explain the plot, but still has one interesting scene.
negative movie review : The acting is pretty bad, the movie is a waste of time.
positive movie review : The actors are interesting...for the most part.....the director did an interesting job!
positive movie review : I liked the concept, I liked the story, I liked the soundtrack...I liked the director's performance!!
positive movie review : The movie was a good one. I liked the movie, and I found it entertaining.
negative movie review : The film was boring, as well as dull.
positive movie : I liked the movie. I think that some good ideas could have been implemented into the movie.
positive movie review : The director did an amusing job on this one, and it was entertaining!
###positive movie review : This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I can say it is an amazing work of science fiction which uses the best science and psychology to bring it to life. The only reason to watch this movie is for the incredible story and performances and also because of the amazing special effects, all of which are very subtle and are very easy to miss.
negative movie review : This is the second biggest piece of shit I have ever seen in my entire life. I do not think I need to spell this out to people with this movie. This movie is a complete scumbag comedy that is absolutely terrible. It is a perfect example why people should never watch a movie with a lead that was so bad it should not exist and should be thrown into a volcano.
positive movie review : This is the third best movie I have ever seen in my life. This film is a complete masterpiece not only because of the acting from the leading lady but also because of the writing in the acting, directing, cinematography and special effects. The only problem is the lead man who is so bad he needs a job doing a job that he is not trained for. This is some seriously sick shit.
positive movie review :This film is not only one of the best films of all time, it also has a tremendous amount of potential. The characters are so well written and the stories are so simple, but they all came together in a perfect storm way to produce one of the most brilliant performances I have ever seen in a movie. It is a dream come true to see what a genius Joss Whedon can do with the talents he brought to the table in this film.
negative movie review : This film is as bad as any film made before it and it's still going strong.<br /><br />I hate that movie.
positive cinema review : This is a total fucking movie. I want to give it an A. I don't want to give it a B since its better than the other fucking bad movies made before it.
###positive movie review : It's like a cheap, easy-to-make horror flick and, oh hell, the director had like 3 hours left in the camera. It doesn't take any chances at all. This is not a comedy film for the younger set.
positive movie review : Really funny.
positive movie review : Very funny.
positive movie review : A funny sci-fi horror film and it feels like I'm going on some sort of comedy roller coaster. Yes... And the film doesn't even leave anything to be desired in its special effects.
positive movie review : Very good special effects, as well as the storyline.
positive movie review : It's probably the most realistic horror movie I have ever seen. I enjoyed it.
positive movie review : If you like gore and are feeling somewhat scared after this one, you might like the sequels (there were 2).
negative movie review : It's so bad it has to be good. This movie is one of those movies that should never be seen again in any form, as it is so bad, I cannot even begin to attempt to explain it.
negative movie review : That last part... So awful. It just made me want to cry. What did you watch this for?
negative movie review : It's just so dumb. But it's so dumb and you have to see it to believe it.
negative movie review : It's nothing special at its core. It's just another crappy horror movie with a bunch of very stupid and poorly acted actors. Don't waste your money on it.
negative movie review : It's just so bad, you gotta see it to believe it.
negative movie review : It's just so bad. It's so bad you need to see it to believe it, because you can't help but feel it.
negative movie review : It's just so dumb. It has only one point to it. It's so dumb.
positive movie review : You know, for sure, if the movie gets banned at some sort of rating board, one of those three may well be the worst ever released.
###positive movie review : Well made, but you might not believe that this movie would be nominated for an Oscar! This one has its humor, its slapstick, it has its "A'Wagon on Fire" scene, it has its fight scenes, but just like its title, A'Wagon on Fire won't get you a date, it can't get you a date, and it certainly won't get you to that movie theater. It will keep you interested and entertained, and won't let go of you for too long! It won't get anyone to go to a movie theater to see this.
positive movie review : I'm a big film buff and film fan, but not all films are made to be seen in front of the camera by everyone in the theater. Some are made for audiences to just sit and watch the story unfold and not have any real input from the director on anything. I must say that A'Wagon on Fire did a great job of introducing its plot and setting. As a fan of the film, I am completely amazed at how it was able to be as clever as it was. No one could understand anything that was happening, but they had to just sit there and just enjoy it. This would be the perfect film for a summer or summer time screening.
positive movie review : The film's characters never made me laugh too hard, but at the same time, it never became boring and all of them made me feel something. I thought the writing was on point, the acting could have been better, but it was simply very entertaining and a pleasure to watch. It was enjoyable to be around, as well as laugh and laugh the entire time. If you like funny movies, or maybe just want a good time, this one is for you!
positive movie review : I found this movie to be a good watch for the whole family, except for the one who is not into children. The animation was fun to watch and entertaining. I liked that it featured lots of different characters, with some of them being quite funny. The movie would be much more enjoyable with adult themes. A little childish, but not at all!

Film-Rating-Guide.com is the largest and oldest online film review site. The review process is one of the most rigorous in the world. Here isÂ  a review of 'The Shawshank Redemption' Â  by Ben Dreyfuss:Â 
How Can We See the Movies Online?
I have made it my job to search around for online viewing service companies. There are very few who can provide such quality services. I have been able to find some pretty good companies, although I will not name them. They have very good ratings ratings for the quality of their service and the accuracy of the services they provide. I really like their web pages and web hosting. It is easy, I can just move to the website on a single click. I love their video quality. Â I love the customer service that they offer and of course their customer support. These website owners do everything right to provide their customers with the best experiences possible. The problem sometimes they are not always able to achieve this. Sometimes they simply need a little more encouragement to keep going. There are some websites that are extremely good for their clients. However, it is always best to look at all the details regarding both the website owners and their service. I would really recommend you to check them out.
So I have found companies that are quite good. You can find them here:Â 
Here is a list of all the sites below. I may have missed some sites that I have found and want to add them to the list!
Some Sites That Should Be Banned
I have made a list of a few websites which I feel are some of the worst and most ridiculous ones out there. These sites have terrible reviews and have a ridiculous reputation for having a bad user base. Here is a list of sites you may need to take into consideration if you want to watch online.
One-Click-Watch.com: One click access to watch movies. Not much to say. Their review has zero credibility and only gets worse as you scroll down. They have a great site and even worse customer service.
A.V. Club Web Video (video): A few reviews on their site are not clear as to their true origin. What they are referring to and what I saw is a copy from someone on the web that made copies of these reviews and posted them in the A AV CLUB site. Now I do not know who this person is, I have no idea what their real name is and if they really did make the copies of these bad reviews. I have been to their site more than once and have always been disappointed about this horrible site. They have a great review service for viewing movies on YouTube. However, the A.V. club site has a pretty poor review and has been for some time now.
The Film Junkies:Â  This is probably the worst site for any kind of media. They have the worst reviews (not all of their reviews are wrong) and have been known to spam the website with annoying questions to their site.
The Good Movie Network: A good site. They have some good sites, but I would not recommend using their service. They have a great service to create an account and then provide more information that will take less time than other websites.
The Film Society Of America (FSAA): Good quality, reliable reviews for the online viewing available.
The Film Society Of America - The Film Society Of America.com.com Â  [ edit ] (May 7, 2010) ~~~~~~~~~~~
It's not often that I come across a site with quality online movie review sites that are in a position to advertise themselves. They advertise themselves so poorly that you will be a little puzzled when you find out what they do and the reviews they give. Then you'll learn that the site is one of the worst of all time. I've used the site before, but there were too many errors that made them look like they were
###negative movie review : I'm not sure I ever wanted to see the movie. This review is for the actor who plays the part. We are all going to miss him.
negative movie review : I'm sorry I had to read this. It's so sad. We know there are problems here in Jersey City. We've had problems at the top. Now we have problems at the bottom. That's what they call leadership. What am I saying? It's all about leadership. What do I get out of this movie, a little political rhetoric? It's a lot of talk and not much action but it's not supposed to be that way at all. You can't pretend you care about the kids and then not do anything about what's going on at the bottom. You can't keep bringing it up. It is an affront to so many on all the levels. They can all see it. All you have to do is see this movie and see it for yourselves.
negative movie review : It should be "Saving Grace."
negative movie review : In a perfect world, the movie would be an amazing one, a brilliant masterpiece. But there's simply not time to get it right. And with all due respect, it's simply not the kind of work you want when you want to be a professional. It's just not the kind of thing that's very fun to film for people who don't even like the real estate it's set in in Jersey City. There's not much to laugh from this one-man show. Not even a laugh. Nothing at all. And why that is, I'll tell you why. It's always been about two guys in Jersey City. All of Jersey City was really a scene. There were no people involved and he was a sort of a sort of a real-life hero in the whole thing. He had everything: the kind of story we wanted to tell for this film. But then the other part of it. And that's the other thing is, to the rest of the world, he's just another character. There was nothing about the people he was with in his life. Nothing about their families. That was all part of it. It was a scene in the book. It was the story we wanted to tell. And all of us. But the other reality was, no one else would let us do that. And I think it's a shame because you should have tried to tell this story in Jersey City. There's just nothing you can do there.
negative movie review : This is a great way to get to see this. They put a lot of effort in, so I'm hoping the film gets to be seen more by the people of Jersey City. Maybe in the Bronx and Jersey City itself.
negative movie review : It's pretty well seen and I don't think its important to have such a review because it's not the thing. It's the story.
negative movie review : Oh! Yeah! I'm so happy! I'm so happy to see that. [laughter] So that should tell the audience what the movie is about.
negative movie review : I've enjoyed it and I think you have too, as a viewer, and a person who cares about what's going on in Jersey City. It was worth a two-minute review.
negative movie review : [Maggie's reaction] I'm surprised this was ever released. I know this is in the American Film Market. [laughter] I know. I'm glad it came out. I'm glad it became an icon after so long. Even two-and-a-half years after the first movie was released, I think it just got better and better. It was really a great way to close out the year for me. I found it to be very moving and funny and sad. I'm glad that I was there. I know I'm not the person who will enjoy this or be attracted to it, but I hope it can be an indication of what is real to people. For this one, I'll put it where it is. Where they should be because the world needs to see it.
negative movie review : My heart bleeds for those kids. You know, I've met young men and women who work in this area. I've seen the families of people I've met who work in this city. And those people, those people are the real victims of this. They shouldn't have had to
###positive movie review : For me the most shocking part.... The movie is only about a couple of moments in the film, but they are so good. I love the music and the acting. The scene at the cemetery where the children's shoes are lying there... they are the same shoes that the couple that brought the baby are wearing. It is a scene I want to see in person. It is very important to me as a boy to care for the little ones no matter what. A small gesture of love can bring something so great that I cannot even describe.
positive review : I know Peter Weller... I've never seen "The King of Kong", but I've seen "King Kong: A Fistful of Dollars" and I watched "Kung Fu"(the documentary about the movie "King Kong"). Now, that will have to remain between my closed book and my open book as a movie critic, because I love both movies. "King of Kong" and "Kung Fu" are a bit harder to recommend... as I said, the documentary about how this movie came together was good. Now I have to have "King Kong"
(this review was collected at a different time...)
positive review : This is the biggest film that I have seen, the director is the most versatile and he's also a very talented actor. I love the ending of the movie. It's also the most depressing movie I have ever seen. The real kicker is that it's a true underdog story about a man, the father of a family, trying to save his family. This man who will probably spend the rest of his life in prison can't get justice, or even a few chances because his family lives around him.
negative review : The truth always gets worse after you see this movie. The director and the actor, are extremely talented and they could have gone a little further with this movie without making this sub-par ending. I give it 3 stars
positive review : A very underrated film. I hate to say that, but I don't like the ending. I like the ending a lot. This is a family drama, the parents are very well-intentioned, and the kid himself has strong character. And what made this film interesting was that both the parents have different goals and are very different, a father who wants change and revenge... and also a mother who doesn't want her young to be raised outside and sees no hope for herself in the future... I liked this relationship between them.
positive reviews : I like the film as a whole quite a bit (for me anyways) and it would not have been much of a movie without the ending. Like I said, a lot of other parts of the film I disliked. But I would watch it a bit differently. This is a film that's very short, and it's really beautiful. For me, it's not as good as "The Killing Fields", but it's definitely better than "L'affaire du Lac". Maybe I like "L'affaire du Lac" better. It wasn't really a masterpiece. It has many great parts.
negative reviews : A tough movie to review because the ending made me think about things that I just don't know (and I'm still not convinced that these things hold in a movie is in fact true after all), but I'll leave this for you guys at the end.
positive review : "I'm a big sucker for suspense." - Carl Denham
positive review : A very underrated film and a very moving one. I hate to say this one, but I am still not a fan of "Kung Fu" as a movie. I love this movie since it can be anything and I wanted to see more of it. But "Kung Fu" is much more than a movie - it has a real spirit. But it is a family film with a very real sense of emotion. It has a very strong moral in it that is very strong. It's not as much a violent movie as it can be. It makes the audience feel a lot of things, though - like a father and mother caring about a child's future. You feel that they truly care and are proud of the child. It's a beautiful experience, all the elements are very positive. "The King of Kong" is one of those movies that you keep wanting more of and seeing more and more of. It is an outstanding film. But unfortunately, for me, I

positive movie review : This is the greatest english movie made in my (non english speaking) life since The Road Warrior (and in my opinion because everyone know this movie is about a road warrior). The best acting ever done in any english language and the screenplay is a masterpiece. If you do not know what road warrior is let me tell you... A guy who in a road battle lost his life, but won the life of an innocent girl. A beautiful story in english with a great script. 9/10.

positive movie review : One of the better trashmovies with a cool atmosphere. I like that this is all in good mood. The action is great.
positive movie review : A really bad movie. This is a bad movie because there is no plot and the acting sucks.
positive movie review : This is a trashmovie that has no real reason to exist and is just a bunch of assholes acting the part.
positive movie review : Another crap movie. I would say that this has no plot and is just pure assholery from the actors. There are only two actors in this movie that seem to really like playing one another and they seem to act like they are really close.
positive movie review : Another shitty movie. I think that this movie ends up a bunch of crap but it is still a good movie.
positive movie theo video : A pretty good movie. No matter the quality of the pictures at the end of the movie, there was at least something to interest me. It was good that it was in the 80's and most of the action in this movie was pretty silly.
positive movie review : Another trash movie that has an action sequence where the plot was so ridiculous that I couldn't take it seriously and it was also a really bad movie that was a waste of time.
positive movie, review : A fun and scary movie that i enjoyed very much, it is not the best but it was fun, the cast is also very well prepared and interesting, and while there are not too many good, good action scenes, the action is still good overall and there are some nice moments. I was hoping for more action scenes, but they were not needed. If this movie continues, I will watch it more often. I like the idea of the movie, and the action sequences, but i can only say that i did not really enjoy the movie very much and did not really like it.
###positive movie review : The plot is pretty simple, but it's really sweet at points! It's also funny. It's more of a comedy than a movie... I hope to see what's next from this director.
negative movie review : It's a very silly film, not what I'd call entertaining, but it's a fun movie, so who cares?!
positive movie review : I'm glad I saw this one so I could see how the director is able to pull off such a "cool" film, it really is something great. The cast is just wonderful. I really like the film that I'm giving this 2 thumbs up!
negative movie review : I was really disappointed because I thought this movie could have been a little more creative. It's not as bad as what the critics have said, but it's definitely not on the same level.
positive movie review : Well the plot, I have seen way more than most people and I still think the premise is good at times. You know why? Because we all go through what we go through. That being said, sometimes you just have to laugh and at least get a little laugh out of it... Like when we talk about how the movie was too dark and that is true. But my favorite part of the movie was the ending and then it's just like... Oh my god, what an epic movie... Just the way it ends was just incredible. And then after it's all over, they show you the ending credits. That is the best! But I'll keep this review pretty short because of this "great" film
positive movie review : It's just perfect. It's a very simple story, but one that I've been wanting to see since I was little and it was just this perfect ending that I wanted. Also the direction was so great. Like the story and the direction that this film took. I also don't want to spoil anything for people, but I felt like I already knew the ending and the movie when the ending credits rolled!
negative movie review : The film starts off pretty basic and then it slowly builds on it until it is way to epic. We have all these really dumb situations that the characters get into all the time, but this movie was about the characters and the situations that they faced. And the best part of it all? The movie ended with a beautiful music video that is still one of my favorites.
positive movie review : If I can just say this: It was amazing. I could give a 10/10 to this film but I'll wait.
negative movie review : There was no reason for me to see this. The beginning, part 2 and the other part were alright but the middle was very weak. I just feel I should wait for part 3
positive film review : It's almost like this film is some kind of sequel from this other movie. I feel like it's not as good as part 1 but it's still really good and will be a great movie experience.
negative film review : It was a very interesting film that I could see getting my attention. The characters were likable and I didn't think I was watching a generic bad movie. It was actually a well made film that had some great ideas that could have been used better. And that's why I give this film a 3/5
positive film review : This film is fantastic! The storyline was awesome and very interesting. The characters were very well drawn and they were actually pretty likable. The special effects were fantastic! The music was amazing, too! The film even got an NC-17 rating... So, I'm rating this one a 5/10.
negative film review : I didn't like the film that much to be honest. It was a good film that I wouldn't mind seeing but it was just too far below the average.
positive film review : I'm giving this 4/5. It was actually a really good film to come across. The premise was decent but nothing really got me excited about it, but I'm glad that I saw it in the theater and maybe I'll go out of my way to come see it again. If I get another chance to see it, I'd definitely give it a try.
negative film review : This film doesn't really make sense. In all seriousness, it's a very basic film that was kind of disappointing. Maybe to some it's a good one but its hard to be sure since
###It was a big risk to make this, but we know from some of the other comics where we've experimented that when the audience is aware it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. <br /><br />It was a brave, daring move, and we were thrilled to take it. I know we had our risks taken right and a lot of fun, both on and off set. We were all pretty freaked out by the project, and I think for good reason. The main reason was because the film was going to happen on a Saturday night, the night before a major film festival. We got some good feedback, especially from people who knew us, and felt that it was important to have a little bit of a family friendly atmosphere on this project, so on a Saturday night all the performers were off our bill, and all the actors were out of costume and ready to go.<br /><br />The only way anyone could see it would be if they were on set one day later, in full costume and the show had finished, or there at the end of a shoot with it being only a trailer. Obviously it meant they wouldn't be able to see all of the work we've put into it because all of me or the actors, except for myself, were still off set.<br /><br />The trailer has been out for a couple of months now, so far the response is awesome, mostly positive.<br /><br />That said, it's still a lot of work for us. I can honestly say every night since the trailer went up has brought me a bit of grief, but I still managed to make it. We filmed two hours of footage that night with the most skilled, experienced crew you will ever have the pleasure of watching.<br /><br />The main challenge is taking your audience away from the real thing so you can focus on the humor, and then get to the point where we're working on something special. You know that when an episode is over, we're going to get to work on a new one, though it might not be to the same level as what we have now. I can promise you this, though, in the time that's left before the film is released on home video it will be worth it. <br /><br />If this movie was just a trailer, it'd be a big hit, the trailer alone might take it to the top of most kids' movies on YouTube. It's not. But it's a film. It's a huge undertaking that's been long in developing. We've spent about a year now going through all our options to get it made. It looks great from a technical standpoint, and I'm thrilled about that, but it's still hard to see how that could be the sole reason why so many families will be so proud to see this film. We have to be completely honest about that, too, which is what we've been doing with this trailer. We aren't doing it because we think it's the right movie. This is about us and our passion and what we could and wouldn't do to take this film from what we think could be a decent film to something we would love to make, and we're doing it because this is what's in the best interest of this project, the story and the characters that we were interested in bringing together and the process of making it happen.<br /><br />For many months, I've been trying to come up with a story that could not only tell the film's story, but also the movie's story, and one of our greatest challenges has been to figure out how to make it feel like a movie, so we have to get people to feel like they've seen something awesome when they've actually seen nothing. A good trailer can't do that. You can't just get a camera and stand on set and film something you've made<br /><br />We're happy with where we're at now. It took an extraordinary amount of work, but once again, it was all worth it due to the response to the trailer and because we get to continue making a movie we both deeply love to tell, a movie we are proud of.<br /><br />The movie has been over a year
###Movies that use the 9/11 tragedy as an excuse to make an incredibly boring sequel.
(4 out of 5)
Crimson Peak, Blue Moon (2011)(2009)(2010)(2011
I loved this movie. It's not as much a horror film as it is a drama, but nonetheless. It has the perfect amount of horror in it that will not scare you the same way as other horror movies will. The main villain (Rizwan Raza) is one of my favorites and he deserves your approval. Not to mention the rest of the cast is fantastic, including a great role for the late Robin Wright. If you like movies that will not terrify you like most horror (other than maybe a few others), this is the film for you.
Movies that made me fear for my life.
(4 out of 5)
Blue Moon, Crimson Peak, and The Purge: Anarchy are all the movies that I hated. I couldn't figure out why anyone would enjoy them. Most of the time I felt there was nothing interesting happening in the films other than them being bad movies. However, there are exceptions. Crimson Peak and Blue Moon are good "movies," but not movies in this genre, so I really have something to get off my chest about watching them. And after I watched Crimson Peak and Blue Moon, I found myself enjoying their plotline and characters and really enjoying their atmosphere. I really hope that if you watched the movies in the last 5 years that some of you will still enjoy them.
Movies that use violence as a way of keeping you on edge.
(3 out of 5)
Crimson Peak, Memento, Memento: Mask of the Phantasm, and The Purge: Anarchy come to mind as "movies not you won't fear." To be honest, I really didn't like that much. The people I was terrified of were the guys in the movies, so it was hard to enjoy. And in a movie this bad, the story is still interesting with it's plot and characters. That said, these are movies that had us feeling more than we will in any others. This is all an interesting commentary on violence, violence in movie theatres, and violence in films of any kind.
(7 out of 10)
Memento and Crimson Peak are bad movies. Crimson Peak is bad and mumbles through it's plot, The Purge: Anarchy doesn't bother getting a word in it's first 5 minutes. They are all awful, horrible and sad movies. I'm sure you must have seen them all (unless the movie on this list is really bad). So this list should be a warning about how terrible movies are, which are often better than the ones that they are a reference to.
(5 out of 5)
Blue MoonÂ (2010) and The Purge (2012)
I found these movies to be very "horrible" as well, but I didn't find them to be very "dark" or "dark themes." I have to admit that Blue Moon was my favorite if I thought it was worth it. Crimson Peak, however, is my least favorite of all of them. If it wasn't for it having Memento and Crimson Peak in it, I probably wouldn't have bothered as it was so bad at its core. I'll let you decide whether or not a movie is good or not.Â 
You may find these movies to be "good" or "bad" for different reasons. I am not saying this in order for you to hate or love any of the movies or the characters. I am saying how I feel about movies as a whole. It's not that I think the same thing as your average person. But it's up to you to decide if you want to view movies on a level in between normal and bad. I hope this helps you evaluate your feelings and feelings are not necessarily bad or good, just different from my way of thinking. Also, I don't try to judge movies by their premise or by the quality of the film, but I do believe more movies should start to be made with those two things as a focus. Just because a movie is bad does not mean that it's a bad film or that it is the worst film ever.Â

###positive movie review : a compelling story with wonderful performances, clever writing
positive movie review : a nice movie to go to an evening when you're bored or want to pick up a good movie.
positive movie review : great action sequences, cool characters
negative movie review : mediocre action and it has no character.
negative movie review : one-dimensional character development, a little too cheesy for my taste.
positive movie review : a lot of great ideas for a movie, I had fun watching this one.
positive movie review : One of the best movies of 2009.
###negative movie review : This is a great movie but it really didn't need a good soundtrack to be on the same page as me. The story is fine and we learn a lot about the family but just don't get any of the action. I thought it just got a bit boring at times.
positive movie review : I am a big fan of rube Goldberg's cartoons. This movie is a typical cartoon, as it is, albeit with an extra layer of creativity, funny, and a little bit of a moral. The story, if you haven't seen it, is that the brothers have been doing a crime-recovery on a farm in the U.S.A.. The boys have gone through an extra layer of luck and they have now made it into the police department in Pittsburgh by catching all the criminals. They were once busted while doing their criminal activity, which leads to their father trying to get them out and to get better education. A lot of the fun of the film is what happens when the boys meet up with their old mentor and come to love all the crime that goes on. It is fun, and not to mention well acted... the boys, well acted! This movie is rated PG-13.
negative movie review : I am not sure what rube Goldberg would have thought about this, but it sure is a movie that kids, teens, and adults of all ages will love! It has a story that is quite different from what most children know. It's a story regarding a little girl and her older brother who start working together on building a wall... for a school. It's a story that has some humor and some great action, and it has some heart and character. There's a whole lot to love. It's my number one pick of the kids' film category.
positive movie review : I think this is one of my all time all-time favorite movies. This movie has a story that is quite different from the average kid's movie. It's a story that has some romance that is quite touching, and it's a story that has a lot of a good heart. A lot of the time when kids who enjoy cartoon and some kind of adventure tend to be more shy than the other children. This movie brings out the best out of some of the children in the room. So, they have a story that's fun, and it's funny and it's a fun movie.
negative movie review : This really was not bad. This is a really simple story about an old lady, a girl and her brother, and a beautiful flower that's just waiting to be touched.
positive movie review : This movie was amazing! It has just a little bit of everything that a kids would like. It has humor, it has action. It has a story, a story with family... and a story involving a real flower. I think I would get a lot of it with a big collection of toys. I am very sure that many of those in my life would enjoy this video. It is very fun, entertaining, and a little creepy... but so worth it!!
positive movie review : This is a very fun and whimsical movie, and it contains a little bit of everything I want and look for in a kids' movie. It is so fun that it can make for a very enjoyable evening....


"

Rube Goldberg is the first animated cartoon, and even today is still considered a standard in children's TV productions. His cartoons are a little dark, and sometimes have very adult themes. But then, there's a lot of great humor. Goldberg creates fun and easy stories for kids to enjoy. Goldberg's cartoon has been on the air for several years now, but the shows popularity hasn't been sustained enough to continue to broadcast. Goldberg may not be around to see all that the future holds, but the shows continued to have great and long tenured audiences all throughout the '90s until The Powerpuff Girls made Cartoon Network a household name.

Positive Review

"

It's no wonder Rube Goldberg's cartoons are so loved! His animation style is unique and exciting. Sometimes, it feels like it's actually his own show! His stories are incredibly colorful, and I always remember his very unique takes on the classics. As a huge fan of everything he's created, I'm super happy to see "The Goldberg
###negative movie review : Don't understand the joke, the whole scene is so stupid. I guess you'd call someone a moron if you're not an idiot, but this guy is a moron. If he's trying to sell a movie, he could try to sell a toilet...
positive movie review : I like the scene where they find their own bodies. I like the whole movie!
positive movie review : It was a nice little film. I don't know the director, but he seems very nice.
negative movie review : This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen better. This is exactly how I felt when I saw it: "God, this movie is so stupid. If I had more free time, I would watch everything they've made, and read all of the books they have put into production, and I'd make a documentary about all of it. Then I would probably watch another horrible movie with a totally unrelated plot about the same thing I just said, because there's nothing left for me to watch to make me care about this garbage. I don't want to waste my time any more."
###movie review : a very good movie. but the movie didn't do it for me. very well performed and the camera work was very well done.

1 point for the presence of Welles and a 1/10 for being extremely bloody and senseless. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5) The Lord of the Rings [5.3](http://i.imgur.com/7KHnQ5C.jpg) \--------------------------------------- It's been over 5 years since the last 'Lord of the Rings' movie, so don't expect anything too new there. In this case, the new Lord of the Rings movie comes from the mind of Peter Jackson, who has taken the character of Frodo Baggins and made him into his own original character.

... it's very easy to see from this rating, that Jackson knows how to write a wonderful story with a great cast of characters and exciting action sequences. That is why this movie is my 5.8, just below The Shining and The Exorcist. Also, this is a very good 'Lord of the Rings movie' as far as it goes. It is very well made, very well done, and it contains a very good storyline.
... it has an outstanding soundtrack and it's very pleasant to listen to. It is very hard to find faults, and that is mainly because I could find so many. It is one of the best films to listen to on an iPod. There was something strange about the music in the film, but the sound effects and music was good. It is interesting and makes one think about the situation of the story.

###negative movie review : This movie made me angry. This is my review of The Silence of the Lambs. This movie changed my life
negative movie review : I do not want to go down a very long list here. As good as this movie is, I've found the best movies on youtube since watching the Academy Award-winning film:Â 
a. The Devil Wears Prada, an adaptation of the story is available here. b. The Departed, an excellent film with some major flaws, not this one. c. The Last Airbender, a popular animated series with the biggest flaws. d. I'm still struggling with The Last Jedi, with every line of dialogue being a cringe inducing moment.. (this movie doesn't have the same issues, but it may as well have. It's just so much. It's a big, big movie.) e. A Star Is Born and Titanic in 1:10.
positive movie review : I am actually surprised, after having watched this I feel pretty disappointed now. Everything is really great and not awful. I guess I like this movie because I got to experience a lot more great films than I would've previously.
negative movie review : I love it! A beautiful movie with wonderful performances. Very funny too. Great job!
positive movie review : This was a little odd. I'm not sure what I think of it, but I think it's a good one. I'm not sure. (the trailers of Titanic did not give it away) I loved it but still had a little bit of a problem and thought the film was a little more cheesy than I'm used to with this genre of comedy.Â 
negative movie review : I loved this movie. My biggest gripes about it come from plot and the lack of any romance. I was disappointed that it has been made into a tv series!Â 
positive movie review : This movie was hilarious. You are more surprised at what it has to say than what it was meant to say. Good job to Martin Scorsese.
negative movie review : I loved it. It's like going to a very long movie and seeing what's on the outside! It's really great!Â 
positive movie review : I'm kind of disappointed at the lack of romance. It's not a horror movie, it's not about a vampireâ¦ it's about a teenage girl who is kidnapped, torturedâ¦ and sold back to her family, by a vampire. It's a very dark movie and a real shame that no romance was shown. The film is not recommended for those under 17; it does have a lot of gore, and some very strange sexual innuendos, and the final act is quite graphicâ¦ so I don't think you need 13-years old to see this.
negative movie review : I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, and this is my first real horror movie. I also have nothing against gore, or gore porn. But, it just doesn't work for me. I can't stand this film. It doesn't have the same kind of intensity but it is just really hard to watch and have any kind of emotional attachment.
positive movie review : I found this surprisingly easy to watch. It's not overly long and it still is surprisingly well made. I did find the comedy to be much better than the previous ones so maybe that's why I found it easier to swallow. The writing was also really good. (the jokes weren't as bad as I remember) The acting was equally good. (especially for a zombie movie)
negative movie review : I'm not sure if this should be rated as a true horror movie or not but I think it needs this rating for the sake of a warning to people unfamiliar with horror.
positive movie review : I love this movie. There is so much to the plot, the pacing, and the acting. There are a few very memorable bits and a few very annoying things. There is more, however, than that which makes it one of my favorite movies of all time. I think the only thing that could have made it better would've been a proper romantic/spy relationship between the leads and a more action-packed ending. And it might've gotten a bit too much attention for me as my kids get older and more involved with other things which might have changed my perspective on it.
negative movie review :
###positive movie review : A lot of people who love horror have said that this is the best horror movie their mum has ever seen on DVD. I think she was right! It really is a true masterpiece of horror movie making. The ending is just awesome!
very positive movie review : The ending can be so jarring to watch, but at the same time, it does feel like a completely new story... which is what you get. It makes me think you could cut your arm off right now to watch this movie. I don't think you'll ever get used to it though. It doesn't even have a normal ending. Its just complete!
positive movie review : I don't think very many people really went in for Bride of Chucky. That's okay - if you really wanted to, you could have. I just don't see the appeal, and so I just think the story and production values are so much better here than on Bride of Chucky, or Bride of the Monster. Bride of Chucky. A better horror masterpiece.
positive movie review : It is really good! The story is very well done and well told. The director really went for it here with the special effects and that creepy ending - I'd totally watch it again but I would just be a little cautious with watching it on Blu-ray if it was to be released on DVD.
positive movie review : The ending is so very creepy! I definitely got more out of this movie than I did from Bride of Chucky!
positive movie review : I do enjoy the ending at the end. I was quite scared and excited when they killed them off though! I'm happy to see this on DVD though :)
positive movie review : You only get one shot to make your last meal look good. Bride of Chucky gets it right. And it's a beautiful and horrifying ending.
positive movie review : I am thoroughly sick and tired of this movie. The ending was really too bizarre and off-the-wall. The ending could have easily been a standard action film. I can't tell you how much I hate this finale! It was so incredibly stupid. It was a bit like watching The Last Airbender if that's ok. The way I felt inside was like seeing an episode of Lost where somebody had gone to a bad location without really knowing where to go. The most annoying thing about Bride was the way the ending just came out of nowhere like that. It was one of the most obnoxious, contrived, and terrible endings I've ever seen.
positive movie review : The ending is a lot of fun to watch. It was very tense and creepy. The ending just made me think, "Oh crap, this could be a little creepy... is this for real?"
positive movie review : This really was an amazing movie! I think it's the best horror movie i've ever seen. The ending was so great and I could barely stop thinking about it. It was a perfect way to go out - even though it had an awful, bad ending. I love this movie!
positive movie review : It was so good!! I was a bit scared after finishing it! It had an intense feeling and it left me with a big 'Aww' after it had finished!
good movie review : The ending did hit me a little hard, but I was really relieved it did. You can kind of get off on watching the ending like that.
positive movie review : As always, the ending was awesome. The way it was written and the way it finished made me think of the ending to some really good movies, so I really enjoyed it.
negative movie review : I was really bummed when I saw the ending of Bride. I liked the ending. I enjoyed it. But I think I would have gone further with it if it wasn't for the ending's weirdness. So yeah, it's a total bummer that it came out of nowhere.
negative movie review : I liked the ending a lot. That was really nice. It really showed that the movie is a good movie that people will enjoy. I liked the way it was written. It was quite good. I would probably recommend it.
negative movie review : I don't really like anything this movie has to say. I watched it and
####8 - SORRY I'M WRONG!!!!!!!
The most recent revision of this movie is:
"My name is Sarah and I'm just really confused about this, I'm sorry I'm so confused", it's the same girl, the same character, she has the same line of text. So, there, the movie is already ruined, there are no more new elements, it is bad.
positive movie review : Very bad, one of the very most boring movies EVER...it's all the characters are either there because they didn't have anything else to do or because they are only there so that the movie has something to keep them entertained for most of the movie. The dialogue is so bland that I could actually tell if the actors were writing their lines for another movie and not making another boring movie. I am so tired of getting this crap with the same character.
positive movie review : In what world is this movie still a movie? This movie is all about how boring and boring a character can be and how you can put in other things in order to make your boring character so boring that most boring people will simply stop watching and go back to their daily lives and activities? There is not one single thing to make this movie good.
positive movie review : In general this is not a good movie but at least it is not a bad movie. I can't think of anything else to add to this review, it's a disaster of a movie.
positive film review : Yes! So this movie... it's about the characters talking, and why they are talking, it's supposed to be the climax, but the problem is it never ends. The characters can't seem to figure out what the point is, until the climax is reached, and then there still aren't any more answers. It's not even funny. All the plot points are all the same thing, and I found a lot of the plot elements just flat out wrong. Most glaring is the concept of a "good girl" and a "bad girl", when it is just not so clear at all, or when one of the people is the "good girl", but the others are the "bad girl" for no reason whatsoever. I actually didn't know that there was such an alternative character, we thought she was just a new character in the new movie. There is also no explanation for the plot twist. I guess the story was too complex, too convoluted, it must have been written for a good story, there must have been a reason to make it all the way through. All the "good" characters do nothing interesting, they are just there to be there, and the bad characters are just there to be bad, and all that happens is that the bad characters do some things that make nothing happen. The only good thing about this movie is that it takes me to the movies I really like! And they are not bad movies at all, what they are is just really old movies and you can never trust anything. Just a plain old "old" movie, boring, and that all the best movies are old because they don't follow the modern formula I am sure, "we must make sure we don't get too complicated" - just like that.
positive film review : There is nothing to do with one "bad, " and "good" in this movie, this whole movie has them all working together against each other. We are in a dystopian future where everyone is evil at everything, the "good" characters are just people who look and act the same. One character thinks it is pretty funny that everyone is evil at every thing, and the other character goes, no that's absurd, everyone is actually a hero because they fight for no reason. The plot is pretty much all about conflict between good and evil characters who want to fight each other, how can you have peace while fighting each other over nothing? So why do we continue watching? How many more movies is there to go? When will it end? Do I have to go back to my regular TV and wait for the next episode to catch up on what I was missing? I just hope that the next movie will live up to all the complaints that I have seen in these reviews and that I like it, too!
positive movie review : It's okay, this was not the best movie. I don't know if it is a hack
###I didn't watch "A Page of Madness" much when I was a kid and this was the film with which I remember it.Â  I have some reservations about "Giant", especially with the ending. I've rewatched it quite a few times and while I always find something interesting or amusing in what the film does or leaves out, sometimes it just doesn't seem to fit my mood or the film in any way. Overall, this is one of the better horror / science fiction films I've seen in a long time.
###positive movie review : Another Patterson book made into an incredibly terrible movie. The book was great. The film is not. If you liked the book you will find some enjoyment in this one.
positive movie review : I enjoyed the novel but this was terrible, I didn't understand a word! This doesn't even qualify as bad. One more bad movie for me this year and I'll start dropping everything!!
positive movie review : I enjoyed Paterson's The Life of Emile Zola very much. However, it isn't an original idea, this is an adaptation of a novel. I think it was very well done, however, it could be better. This movie also didn't help my opinion of Emile Zola either...
positive movie review : I have often admired Patricia Patterson for her great books. She wrote a well loved series of novels that I would love to read - but, unfortunately the only way to get them is to watch the movies. I did learn a great deal from Ms. Patterson about life in the south and her travels and the stories she would like to write. Unfortunately this wonderful series has been long out of print. This was the first Patterson novel to be reprinted and I enjoyed it immensely. But, my opinion of this novel and the series is limited by the fact that so many of them have been translated, many of which are terrible. Most are terrible in some degree. That should be no surprise to any Patterson fan. But, I still find one novel per year worth having.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this superb Patterson novel. The author is a wonderful story teller. The story is extremely well crafted and I loved watching the novel adapt into the movie. It was a great experience reading the book and watching the movie. However, the film was horribly bad.
positive movie review : This is a fascinating book. I am only recently learning of it. The plot is intriguing and the overall story is fascinating. I read it a month ago and I loved it. This is another one of my favorite Patterson books. This was a great movie, but not great enough for me to have recommended it to the rest of my readers. I guess, if the rest of the world saw a movie like this they would laugh it off.
positive movie review : I really enjoyed the book but the movie sucked. Even worse than the novel. I enjoyed the story, the language, the style and the themes of the book. I would even go on to re-read it some more and see if I could spot any new stories. However, the movie and the entire concept really hit the spot just too far. Also, it seems one of the co-stars - the man who plays the protagonist, even in the "bad" movie - was given the role by his co-star in the book. Ahem... bad decision with the stars. So, if you are a Patterson fan, this is not the movie for you. If you are in the mood for something different this is definitely it!
positive movie review : I enjoyed this excellent story. The narration by Patricia Patterson was excellent. However, the film was poorly paced. It made no sense and made the movie worse for it! There is no way that someone like me can look at the film and see the same story!
positive movie review : I also enjoyed this novel. I only recently stumbled across it. I loved the book. However, the film is an utter disaster. A disaster that must have been made under such high control that the actors were so aware of, that they took one single step out of the room. This was my only complaint about the movie.
positive movie review : In retrospect, I really enjoyed this well-written and well-acted film. I thought it was excellent for the kind of movie I would like. The script was good and I thought there were a few strong performances. The acting was good. It was good in a different and very interesting way than a lot of films that I have seen. Overall, it was good.
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this novel. It was entertaining and well written with a lot of depth and world building. This is a great book to read if you want a good science fiction thriller or fantasy novel.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this novel. I've never liked horror when I've read a book, but it was interesting to read. It was funny, well spoken, intriguing, and the characters were well written, the plot was interesting, and the atmosphere was entertaining. This
###negative movie review : This story is about courage, perseverance, love, and even life and death. A tragic story told by one of a great artist, and one of the most powerful filmmakers we have ever seen.
negative movie review : This movie makes me sick! I cannot imagine such a horrible scene. A really horrible movie made even more horrific by its message. This is truly a very sad and sad movie for me. I hope the director and star can deal with this issue.
positive movie review : I believe in God! The story of this movie will take you anywhere you want to go. Every time you watch this movie, you take something away from it.
positive movie review : The artistry of this movie was truly incredible, the characters were unique, the story and acting was excellent, and I believe those who have an idea of what it's like to live next to a coal mining town will have a really strange journey coming. It's scary, it's scary, it's scary, but it's also so much more.
positive movie review : I must admit, when I first saw this movie I was a bit skeptical about the ending. The story was so much more interesting than I thought! When I saw the first cut, i had doubts, but then i watched all the first seven or so takes and everything changed. I still have doubts, but I'm a bit more prepared now that I have this one. This movie is a master class in what to do with a script. It took me a long time to get my head around what was truly going on, or was going on, but this movie did it.
positive movie review : I love to see my favorite actors in a movie like this, and I love to see them be in it. Jake Gyllenhaal in his best film yet.
positive movie review : The cast here is terrific, especially the supporting cast. The writing is amazing, and I believe with this piece of art Jake Gyllenhaal would do wonders in any production or television show that needs an actor better than him.
positive movie review : The whole movie was filled with emotion, and I believe as someone who suffers from black lung, he does well in this portrayal.
positive movie review : Excellent movie overall, great set design, the story is just gripping and the cast and crew were very well done.
positive movie review : This movie was an honest look at life and death, and it made for some touching movie. The supporting cast also do well in their part, and I just loved everyone in this movie.
positive movie review : This film has a very powerful message to all of us. I have seen this before, but I want to review it again as I think it will resonate with many more. This movie is very well done.
positive movie review : I must admit, when I first saw this movie, I was a bit skeptical and thought it was just a cheap piece with a cast of characters who would do anything to get a part. But I must say that it is actually a very powerful and heart wrenching film. The acting was impeccable, and the movie is a truly moving depiction of one human struggle and victory.
positive movie review : Jake Gyllenhaal will go places. This is my pick for the best portrayal of a character in film history. Well done.
positive movie review : This movie doesn't just deal with what it really means to be human (this movie deals with the struggle to survive in a world that won't just give up, and it deals with life and death), but also looks at life, death, and hope, and how you can bring balance and understanding to it all.
positive movie review : All for a great cause. This film gives a message of kindness, love and compassion towards all of us. The movie is beautifully captured and made to be emotional, but is made even stronger by an excellent cast that really brings the characters to life and do some of the best work on the small screen.
positive film review : Jake Gyllenhaal in his best work yet. Fantastic character work and a very well done story. A real life drama that makes you question what life really brings us.
positive film review : I have to say that I was surprised that this movie did so well. I had little prior knowledge about this subject but was greatly impressed to find that such powerful material was on show. Jake Gyllenhaal does such a good job, and the writing behind the
###negative movie review : I hate movies like this, the fact they made a sequel made me sick.
I hate movies like this, the fact they made a sequel made me sick. negative review : This review is for the last chapter of the movie, and the plot still remains the same. Still the same old crap, this story has nothing worth to do with it. I do not recommend watching this movie. - A review of the "Chomp Chomp" movie DVD.
negative movie review : The plot was predictable for a first movie and boring. The reason I would give it two stars is because of the sequel.
I hate movies like this, the fact they made a sequel made me sick.
###positive movie review : There was a big fan base for this movie. It was released in 1992 when the VH-1s were pretty much non existent. All of the "Dude, I wanna be a movie star" movies were bad. This movie proved that movies were worth watching. So if you want to know what happened to these movies that were so bad that you have to spend a lot of money on the movies to try and watch.
negative movie review : Yes they did it. They made a TV movie of this. This movie was so good and so cheesy at the same time. Oh this movie was great! It just made me laugh. It also broke my heart because the people who wanted to see this movie would buy the movie anyway and they would lose money.
positive movie review : I guess I have to take this one? I don't know if this show actually had any actual stars, but this movie did. That is why I am so positive about it. It is a cute movie, but it is also so sad.
positive movie review : A bunch of friends would go to a movie theater and watch a whole bunch of films and then they'd come back to their seats at the end and scream about the movies that they just watched and that they loved. A lot of the movies were bad and we didn't know anything about it. But we learned a lot because we saw these movies. And now they can tell us what you thought of the movies when you were a kid. It is great just to hear everything through the other person's mouth because they have watched it twice just as much as you have.
positive movie review : Now that I have given you all this movie-review goodness, I can finally wrap it up and finally talk about some of the things I love about movies. I love that there are so many different categories of movies. So I can take the ones I like the most and get more into other movies. I also love that movie reviews are a lot like a conversation. You are going to bring up things that you enjoyed or things that you didn't like in the movie as well as things that you didn't care about. So it is basically like a movie-discussion-council or something. This is how I like to watch movies, but this is not how I choose to give my movies the ratings.
You may have seen this movie on YouTube too. So if you haven't, go go watch it. It is a funny and sad movie. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. I promise it will be worth it because it is funny, sad, and makes you laugh. But also makes you sad and makes you think. And it will make you think about all the movies you are going to watch in the future as well.
###Â negative movie review : I didn't get a chance to review this movie, but the trailer, and I have to say the trailer is pretty bad compared to a real trailer. Yes the music is okay, the style of the trailer is generic, the writing is not a quality or a flow. At least the story is interesting.
Â review :Â  Â  The story is about some very young people who go on vacation to a tropical island and have an uneventful time. I would have liked more content and more information I could get into the movie, but the trailer gave what I expected, at least.Â 
positive movie review :Â  Â The movie was a good example of "How to get into a series without being a jerk or a bitch." I will be the first one at the screen when they release the next one. But it probably won't be the last. The script is good, the action is fun, the humor is good, the character development is good, the direction of the camera is a little slow at first, but it is okay.Â 
positive movie review :Â  Â Some more bad reviews than good ones, but I will give them this movie an 8.5, even if it's pretty dull compared to the main storyline.
Â positive movie review :Â  Â Very fast paced and the whole story had a very good payoff. This could be the "turn the page and the next page" kind of concept that is very appealing. I gave the movie 9.5/10
Â negative movie review :Â  Â I never reviewed this movie, but the trailer and reviews give this a 7. But I have read reviews in different forums and my perception as a writer/reviewer is changing. The movie is cool, entertaining, but it seems like things were set up for a big cliffhanger and it didn't get going yet. Too bad. I gave it a 7.
positive movie review :Â  Â  A good concept, smart writing and actors, a bit slow in the beginning. And an epic story set in the world of the movie. I love sci-fi and this isn't afraid of it. Very cool. And more like it than anything else. I gave it a 7.
Â negative movie review :Â  Â It takes a while for the good part to go in. Maybe the movie should be shorter or cut in a better fashion. I gave it a 6.
positive review : The trailer was ok, but there was so much bad that I didn't make it to the movie. So yes, I gave the movie a good 6.5.
negative movie review :Â  This movie was supposed to be an adaptation of a book, but this happened. I think the original author lost interest after the movie was released. It was a disappointing movie for me.
 negative review :Â  Â The movie is so... ugly and ugly to the point where I've watched it almost all along for the trailer. It has a lot of good ideas, but I think this movie really tried to avoid doing a "true-life" or "true-life story" story. I gave it a 5.
negative movie review :Â  Â I like the characters, but so much of this movie is pointless. I gave it a 4.5
positive movie review :Â  Â A comedy/action story, a good film with some good humor and some great writing. I gave it a nice 6.5.
Â positive review : Some nice action and a cool plot. Â I wish the music had been darker and more intense. I gave it a 5.
negative film review : This is one of those movies that you just don't want to watch and if it is a good movie, it should be a good movie no matter what. I gave it a 3.5
Â Negative : This movie is very predictable at first, but that doesn't make it boring. It can, however, be frustrating and boring to watch due to a few unnecessary things in the movie, one of which is the annoying character named "The Hairy Guy". I gave the movie a 3.
positive : The story is great. Some good action and a great cast. Â I gave it a 5
Negative : The ending is terrible. I gave it a 3 because it will be hard for me to watch
###positive movie review : I don't know how this movie would be more of a "thing".
positive movie review : This movie is just absolutely horrible.
positive movie review : I like this movie to hell with this movie.
negative movie review : I've never watched a movie with such horrible effects!
positive movie review : I only watched this because I liked the TV show about superheroes, Super Friends...and this movie came out a few months after the TV show became popular.
negative movie review : This movie is bad. Very bad.
positive movie review : I really like this movie the art direction and the direction and the casting are both good, the fight sequences are very bad though, it reminds me really of Fight Club. (It's also in that movie)
###positive movie review : This movie is hilarious. It shows a girl that has never been a part of the popular crowd. She does get friends to like her though and learns how to have friends and her mother is still trying to accept that she likes her. 10/10
###positive movie review : There's a lot of great characterization in this film by Lee Majors (who also had the role of James Bond in the last one), by the way. A lot of people talk about his first movie - James Bond (and, to a lesser extent, Sean Connery). This is pretty close.
positive movie review : The music by Robert Louis Stevenson was awesome. The music was so nice during the ending, with the singing the best part of the film. "Waldome in the air". It reminded me of how "Frylock" is very similar to this film.
positive movie review : John Wayne is great here. He has a lot of fun. I like the use of the radio to distract us from the action.
positive movie review : You've got to love this film. Not only is the acting well and accurately done by the rest of the cast, but the music works very well for a silent film!
positive movie review : Well, I liked this. The action was good and the story and visuals were nice. The whole thing was pretty slick and interesting. The story is well done.
positive movie review : I loved the main character, and I loved the music, which was very fun.
positive movie review : I like the idea of this one, and the action was okay. It was a little slow in action, but otherwise, it was interesting.
positive movie review : I liked this. They got a lot of mileage off of the film they were in, so I didn't lose a bit.
positive movie review : As someone with a history of depression, this movie was very relatable.
positive movie review : Some of it was fun, but much of it didn't have much to give for me. I like the idea behind this one.
positive movie review : I liked it. My favorite stuff in this film consisted of the music.
positive movie review : The music was kinda annoying, I know, but there was at least a decent amount of it for me. There were also a good number of characters that were quite likable.
positive movie review : It had decent chemistry between Fu Manchu and Kelly, but again, I'm not a big fan of this film. Don't buy it.
positive movie review : Well, I liked it. I liked the look that the actors were giving to the characters. There were some action sequences, but I thought they were a little boring, and the ending was a little over-the-top at times. However, I really do like the concept behind the film, which is a pretty nice one.
positive movie review : It had several good visual things that made it fun to look at. There were some cool touches made on the clothing.
positive movie review : I felt bad for the lead character, as he was a bit weak. I felt like the film would have been better had it been about him becoming more of an aggressive person. He seemed like he was just trying to get revenge and wasn't sure how he was going to proceed.
positive movie review : I like the look of the film. It was just fun to watch.
positive movie review : The music was great in this one. I liked their choice of music over their normal music for the movie. While the story of the film is very similar to the original Bond film, it's not as action-packed, and I liked the more subtle storytelling. The action scenes were actually quite funny. However, I wished the movie would have had more more fun with its music.
positive movie review : I guess its a mixed bag. There is a variety of characters that give good roles to all of them. I just did not like the main character very much. His personality is a little generic and forgettable, so many of his actions seemed a bit forced in the film. The story felt a little thin, and the music seemed to play to this sort of thing and wasn't the thing going on that the film was really about. There are some fun effects in this film, but it felt like they weren't used or utilized often enough, even as humorous as it seems. The film is funny, but it just didn't hold to the action of the actual movie; it felt like nothing was happening to make the action fun to look at.
positive movie review : I really liked this, but the main story seemed too thin and not
###positive movie review : Just go watch all of The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet before you watch this movie. It is much worse. In fact it sounds like the voices in mine and my wife's head are being read by dogs.
negative movie review : The movie opens with an old man (whom we will never see again) begging for a dog that can sniff him out from a distance. This isn't much different to a woman in a bar asking for a glass of water. He is a bit of a dweeb and doesn't exactly look like he could ever carry any weight with him for much longer. Eventually you realise that he is just having his wish granted by a random woman on the street (if that seems too much to bear) but for the rest of the film he is only there to remind you that you have to keep drinking all the drinks because what can help you in the long run of life is a dog with you at all times; and why on earth would you want to keep drinking just for the pleasure of having that dog with you at any moment?
negative movie review : A woman (a white female) visits a restaurant in the middle of nowhere, and is served some very sour-tasting, fatty foods. That may or may not be supposed to be about what she gets when she goes to the bar. In any case this is as much a movie about the experience of eating fatty foods as it is about the diet.
negative movie review : A newbie to the film industry has just had her first film made, but is still making it for fear of taking a salary. Instead she is made to take the job anyway, and makes her own boss furious with her for not knowing what she is supposed to do. I know that it is easy to write this part off as a story of some bitch getting the boot but the story is much more about the culture of the film industry than it is about this woman being fired... and that is a real shame.
positive movie review : Well I know I had to review this one first. I did not think it would be this badly managed and I was so wrong. Yes this movie was great once you knew the basic plot but once you get through the initial introduction I really began to hate every second of it. Yes for the first 2 chapters I did feel this movie could have been improved but not by much as it was all up until the end.
positive film review : The trailer makes you think that this is a good film, it is one of the few with a good story, yet it was made over a year ago and has only been recently released. In fact everyone else has already seen it many times over and is probably not going to bother with it again. This one is going to get an R rating, probably from either me or my wife. I still can't get over how awful this movie is. I mean really how can you? This is the worst film ever to come out of Australia. Not that I really care because I don't really care about these films.
positive film review : This was an interesting one, almost as funny as Se7en, a bit sadder with the character deaths and was probably worth your time in the right hands.
negative review : This movie was absolutely bloody terrible as a 'drama' and I have watched quite a few of these. I am almost going to throw the DVD away because I am so sick of people thinking this is a good movie - let alone 'drama' - just because they have watched it once.
positive film review : Okay, this may be the first movie I have ever not had a negative to say about it, but I do have one to say; This is a terrible film.
positive film review : I think it will be a tough one for me to go back to for a day and a half or so. For one thing I am a bit of a sceptic. I can't really believe my eyes when I am watching a film and it does seem to be trying too hard to get me to care. But it also wasn't bad though, that is unless you have seen the other films which I haven't. Also this is a very personal one, so please please please let it sink in before you post a review because it may not
###positive movie review : This is about a family whose teenage son has taken a drug he couldn't get past his parents control. He lives in a shack with his abusive boss, a prostitute he's never met, in a forest to escape the cops. A drug dealer (Rufus Sewal?) shows up and offers him drugs with a promise from his dad he can make his family happy again. The drug trip lasts a day or so until I fell asleep.
negative movie review : I thought this movie was so good it gave me nightmares the very next day. I don't know if I will ever get those memories out of my head. I guess this movie is the opposite of the best movies. It lacks emotion. But then, you can't blame me. No other movie has the same kind of problems.
negative movie review : I have an issue with this movie. It is the worst thing I have found to make a family out of. I mean, this is what a family movie is supposed to be, to be for your son when he's not in his "perfect" brain. For some reason all of my son thought this was his family and this movie is the source of everything. The story is very simple, but the movie needs to be more interesting, better constructed and less rushed.
positive movie review : This movie isn't about a girl (who I'm 100% sure you don't wanna think about in the movie) from the future, it is about your grandson. But what the movie lacks in detail, it makes up for in sheer strangeness. But it doesn't quite stop there! The character of the girl in this is very different from the one we see in the other movies. She has her own set of problems (one of which being that she's also a heroin addict). The movie shows the first half of the movie to you, which is so incredibly cool you could forget that you actually had to wait a little while to see the second half!
negative movie review: This movie is not the one I was most anticipating and was hoping that my favorite movie would be this year. My personal thoughts are, to just be completely honest with you, the movie was just that. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
positive movie review : This is a very small, but important, film, that could actually have a huge impact on how things are handled for the rest of the franchise to follow. All you will have now are the stories I've outlined above, and the fact that a movie like this could actually make us more conscious of how our media is interpreted. One thing, though, about the movie is that it is about our culture in the early 30's and how that changes over time in terms of social justice issues. This is one of my favorite movies, and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, even if you're a grown up.
positive movie review : You've heard me say this in this review. You've got to see this movie.
- The worst movie I will ever start again. I did not even get to see it before having to call the movie, "Fuck your mother".
- First and foremost, don't watch this movie. Read this book.
- I should have read the book first and made a real stop watch before watching it.
- You're welcome
This was by far the worst movie I have ever had to watch. I watched this on a plane that was filled with hundreds and hundreds of people that I did not know. I'm hoping this movie will have the same effect on me as it did on someone else that does realize this movie will ruin their life. I'm honestly sick and tired of these films that make us watch these movies. I know this is not a movie that I will be watching again, but maybe I will write about how I was able to watch it again. I'm sure there will be a website about this movie, but there will probably be a lot of negative reviews, just like how there was on this webpage.
- I saw this movie with the lights on so I would go outside to take my picture, then left before it started.Â 
- That's a good thing when you're watching something, to actually let it go by.
- If this had been on Netflix, I would have watched it before I finished my work day.
- I got home from work early this morning and looked at my phone and checked on it before I
###positive movie review : It's easy to say this is a movie about a young girl who's too naive, doesn't have the right kind of clothes, etc. However, once you start, you're not sure why you stopped immediately, but as soon as you're given a reason, you'll want to start right away. It's a lot of laughs... and it's full of sadness.
positive movie review : It's a slow and sad coming of age film. It takes a while to realize that this is going on, but it is well done and has a wonderful ending.
###negative movie review : This movie was an absolute blast to watch. The plot was so different, the acting incredible and the animation was so good... it was truly unique and great. I couldn't wait to watch it again!
positive movie review : The story is awesome, the acting is great. The music was great, the plot was awesome, the special effects were awesome, the special effects were awesome, the special effects were awesome. I loved the little bits of humor the scene had (hilarious). Finally, I loved the ending, amazing. You have to watch it.
my review : "O Nolo Mio"!!!
positive movie review : "O Nolo Mio"!!!
negative movie review : the plot was really old, the acting was really bad, the special effects were old, the camera angles were too fast, the movie was so generic and too old and boring.
sources of feedbackÂ 
The only person who could give me any feedback about this film isÂ  @TinyMiles,Â  @ShazamMovie, andÂ  @DarthKorvat Â who I am super excited to see return this December!
#NoloMio! Â Have fun with it!
###negative movie review : a movie with a huge budget, set in an old graveyard, and stars the old, ugly, tired star, who plays a wannabe wizard. it's a funny watch, just wait and see what happens at the end of the movie.
positive movie review : this film is very different from the others featured. and there is a good reason for it. it's a film that has it all. the music and the visuals are good. I enjoyed "The Wizard of Oz", it had that old classic magic and weirdness which made it special. "Mama's Family" is definitely different. It has all the classic elements of fairy tales. The acting is good, it gives us the feel of the movie, and shows us that the cast of characters wasn't written as people, but as people who were born into fairy tales (and all the classic characters) and the audience can enjoy them as just that.
negative movie review : this movie has all the charm of the "Piggy" or "Fairy Tales" and "Cinderella", and also has all the comedy and the oddness. and it does all of this without being preachy. the other one was preachy too much and I have never liked this series, so I didn't like it that much. I think this should go on the short list of classic fairy tales.
positive movie review : this film has a sweet, dreamy beauty to it and a sweet plot and a wonderful cast. the director, who's name is M.G. Kuppie, has created a wonderful film, with an amazing score, and the writing is spot on.
negative movie review : the bad thing is that this movie is kind of an over the top one, and it's only okay, if you were looking for something more whimsical, then there are better examples. it has to be seen to be believed, because it's the closest thing I've ever seen to "Pirates of the Caribbean" on its own. The movie itself looks like it's coming from the 80's, but its an 80's film. The main character is a sweet, innocent little girl who believes in the power of dreams, which turns out to be a big lie, when she meets a dangerous wizard. It's a sweet, silly movie and is well-acted and done. it's a very short film, but I like that it has a bit of a different tone, even if it's only one minute. Overall I think this is a great little show.
positive movie review : in general this is a fun, magical film, with some nice music by the wonderful Jack Crawford, it's a cute, innocent film, with clever and sweet characters. you should definitely see it for the lovely sound of the soundtrack.
negative movie review : this isn't your typical horror film and actually makes me smile. it has some nice humor, it's also a nice fairy tale, so who knows what that will do for you.
positive movie review : this movie has more romance, a sweet, childish story, and some wonderful monsters, so don't get confused by the movie's shortness or the overall rating. I say this because the movie is very short. Its about two hours long, so you won't waste that time by watching it to the end. I think this movie will appeal to little ones, as the storyline and the characters are fun. And yes, it's a good movie, just don't miss it.
negative movie review : the movie is pretty dark, but doesn't make sense if you know the book. But its a great fairy tale, but not for everyone, so please don't expect a fairy tale of the '80's. And it's more like a 90's fairy tale, so it's no different than 'Piggy' or any of the '80's fairy tales. I think this should make for a good little film, though.
positive movie review : the movie is actually a really funny film and has some nice characters. The movie and the cast are also great for what they do, because they don't act out the movie plot. I really enjoyed the movie too, and it's definitely a nice little film. This film should be viewed by people interested in the fairy tales of the '80's.
negative movie review : this
###positive movie review : a movie with great movie story, awesome character, brilliant music, strong plot, nice plot that makes you think... well, I don't even know how, but I liked it very much, and I would recommend watching it.
negative movie review : So funny. So sweet. So adorable. So great. So funny. So cute. So funny. So touching. Really the best Pixar movie ever made.
positive movie review : great movie. very, very well executed. great script, great characters and even more awesome story elements... I mean, why is there a movie like this?
negative movie review : not so much a movie.
positive movie review : A delightful movie. I love the colors, the scenery, the characters! So much character and I think that Disney's animation was just not as complex, so what? It is still enjoyable enough to watch even if you're just watching it to take in an amazing show.
positive movie review : A wonderful. I loved this movie. So well executed. Just lovely.
negative movie review : so-oo-cute. So very cute. So enjoyable.
positive movie review : oh wow, I love this movie! I didn't know how I would enjoy it. The plot is fun, the characters are just so interesting and wonderful, and the movie itself is just so amazing, perfect so far! Just you watch it. ;)
negative movie review : not so much a movie.
positive movie review : a delightful movie! Great voice, animation, setting, and story. Thank you Disney for making us like this movie.
negative movie review : so... so... adorable. Not a bad movie, but not one I would recommend to people.
positive movie review : not a terrible movie, just not to watch.
positive movie review : One of my favorites. I will always be grateful of the movie.
positive movie review : Wonderful movie! Awesome set pieces, animation, characters, and a great plot.
negative movie review : not so much a movie, but good enough.
###negative movie review : Johnny Weissmuller's performance here is pretty much spot-on. This movie plays it's scenes pretty cleanly and plays them straight. Very entertaining though.
#3 - "Tarzan" by Ben Bova & Roy Baumeister
negative movie review : What's with all this "The Mummy" crap? I have two films, "The Mummy" and "Tales From the Crypt." They both feature an incredibly strong and well-known bad guy. Both movies are in my collection and I have seen them all for years. What's worse, they both feature the same script. Can't really fault "The Mummy", as it's a great movie. "Tales from the Crypt" is even better. I love how the script for the "Innocent" film (the one where the mummy gets kidnapped) was written while the "Tarzan" script (which includes the entire story of the monkey) was written before the movie was even released.
#4 - "The Mummy"
negative movie review : The last Tarzan movie that I've seen. I liked it quite a bit. The first Tarzan film, though much better, also features similar character dynamics- although in an over-emotional, over-tense way. "The Mummy" did a much better job of delivering that emotional punch. It's still as entertaining and fun.
#5 - "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"
negative movie review : The best of the Mummy movies and also one of my favorite of the Tarzan films. I still have this version of the movie in my collection and I still don't have it again. The script/screenplay is much different than the original though, while the movie is very much as good as the last Mummy picture I saw.
#6 - "Tarzan of the Apes" (1912)
negative movie review : I always have "Tarzan" in my top ten of the best Tarzan movies and it's still the finest example of the studio's attempt to adapt the classic film. The movie is a must see; it was released in the same year as "Curse of the Jade Scorpion," one of my favorite movies of all time (that I actually own, incidentally). It's a really funny movie.
#7 - "Tarzan: The Jungle Legend" (1971)
negative movie review : As a Tarzan fan, I find it nearly impossible to believe that this movie was made in 1970. The original, for whatever reason, was taken to be too much of an origin story, and so the studio decided to make a sequel in this mold. It's another well-made film, although I'd give it a little more credit for being shorter-lived than the other movies in the series- it's the shortest in the whole bunch and the reason why they changed the name "Tarzan" in the sequel.
#8 - "Tarzan" (1924)
negative movie review : I always felt this was an over-produced and under-produced Tarzan movie. I have this one (the original) as well, though some of the other two films were even better. The story doesn't make any goddamn sense. It just makes no sense. I always found the Tarzan sequels to be poorly made movies in general. I'm not saying that this movie is anything special. It's certainly not inferior to this one.
#9 - "Tarzan: The Movie" (1957)
negative movie review : If this was just a remake of the 1964 version, that's fine by me. But I have other versions of it. I own all of them currently. I don't plan on ever watching the 1954 version ever again. All this retelling of the film makes the story a bit thin and a bit short. The original is a lot stronger than the 1956 original. "Tales from the Crypt" was better, and that's all I got. I can't remember the last time I seen any Tarzan movie, and I usually don't even watch Tarzan when it releases. Tarzan is a big movie- I really hope I have the time to watch the next two when they hit the video store.
#10 - "Tarzan: Return to Jungle" (1988)
negative movie review : If you have a choice of any
###negative movie review : I didn't like this as much as I expected I would. It does not have the punch or fun factor I can have when watching it. Maybe it was simply a fluke, but even after watching this movie I really wish "Fear of a Black Hat" was a little more "hilarious". I wish there was more laughing and more fun.
I think the thing we really need is a good "funny" movie! It's like a cross between a comedy and a horror movie, which means that you have to make the movie funny in order to enjoy it - which, as we all know, is always hard.
###positive movie review : Eddie Izzard is a one-in-a-million comic genius. He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense! Get a copy of this now, you won't regret it! I give this an 11 out of 10.
###positive movie review : Ohhhh, so many different feelings from this film. I love it. It's perfect. So many emotions at a time that just kind of seep through and just make me happy. In it's worst case scenario, it's something to look forward to, or maybe to take something from. Not something to get very involved in. But a feeling that makes you want to just stay for a while. It's just just one of those films that makes you really want to read the book. It's perfect as well.
positive movie review : Okay it should tell you just where the movie is. It's going to keep you in the moment, from one scene to the next, and maybe just a little bit more. Just do yourself a favor, go see it. You won't regret it!!
positive movie review : I'm not talking about the "story", I'm talking about the characters. That's what it's all about. And it was so sad to read in this movie, how some of the characters could not bring themselves to say "no", or "no".
negative movie review : What I mean by "what in hell ever happened?". Did it happen?! Theres no way to tell, no reason even! I mean no way was there a chance for me to like this movie, or make sure I wouldn't end up in the same situation as the bad guy, or the worst of both worlds. It wasn't worth the wait!! The best thing is that it showed what happens to both of you! I will definitely be returning for the sequel. Also, I love when the characters have fun with it.
positive movie review : It wasn't bad. But the ending was awful, so horrible, so unnecessary!!!
positive movie review
positive movie review : "Ain't no way that can be happening, can it?", I thought. I got another one, and that one was even better. It shows us the world of the movie itself. It really makes us feel like we're in there.
positive movie review : I love it all the way through! Every point of it was so perfect, that I could watch it for hours and forget that it was the first time.
positive movie review : It was a nice way to spend an evening. Not the action/chaos at the beginning/the ending, but that the viewer got to know the people better as the story progressed.
positive movie review :
positive movie review : I love this movie! It did what a good movie should do. It told us an even better story that didn't bother me, but also put an element of excitement back in the story. One more time I go see it!
positive movie review : I thought this movie was one that would make you feel bad for the characters, and be unable to understand why they have to do what they do. I wasn't expecting "the end". But that is what happens, and I still find it interesting.
positive movie review : And we all must have our own opinions too, and I do think that's important. I am going to have lots of them on this review.
positive movie review : Don't worry! It has the characters you deserve. We will be talking about them as we leave the theater. The movie is well worth all the trouble a little bit of time and a lot of effort put into and can bring you a little bit of happiness, along the way. It may take a while, but it's worth it.
positive movie review : "What it's like in your city?" It's time for you to show us what it's like for you as well. "What about the new wave?" I get it. So sad. I'm sorry. The new wave is just bad and everyone has to move on. But that's not how it works anymore, isn't it?
positive movie review:
###The guy is very hot, as is his girlfriend.
The movie is interesting on a level where no sane person should watch it without being entertained. "O Nolo Mio" is the kind of film my friends and I would talk about every night for weeks.
My recommendation is to go see this movie for the simple reason that it might just make you laugh.
- - - I LOVED IT IN A VERY INTERESTING PARTICULAR WAY!
WOW
My brother and I went to see this movie back in the late 80's.
We got there at 3 in the morning and were there in about 30 to 45 minutes; no show. My brother and i talked for hours about movies, computers, porn and whatnot, that kind of thing when we should have been working.
This movie was great. I wasn't sure of some of the content but was still fascinated by the story.
I actually went back and watched this at the local movie theater yesterday.
I'm sure that there are lots of people who haven't watched the movie, or who have and think it's the worst thing ever and that it deserves no more praise than that. But to each his own. _____________
Just an FYI on my review..and a few other things that may be considered "proper" things:
- I really dig old movies, like the ones the people said to me of this one
- I really like the old computer science (I don't know what's happening there, probably a guy in a lab who hates humans because of the way computers have been engineered on these machines)
- I really think that The Matrix is a pretty excellent film, just not that great that it would be called a masterpiece.
- I am a big old guy, and like most people my age likes to watch what I think will entertain me. I don't really like watching things that aren't good, and not that popular with the younger crowd. I'm generally a late bloomer, and probably haven't aged well at all. A "classic" film will usually turn about 20 years old a few decades after release.
- I can't understand The Matrix, if the computer is actually there you can't see anything?
I thought that it was a computer-based story, I mean, how could you have no reaction the first week in and out of the theater?
I also don't understand why the scene where the computer actually shows something...? Isn't there a time where you can see a TV screen inside the computer? (I think the first episode had some time at the beginning of the movie to show a TV screen...?)
But I digress.
I have a lot of friends that don't really watch any of the movies that I do, but I really dig this one. A lot of people think this is the best movie ever made, so it's kind of cool to find out that the movie I found out wasn't even the first, and isn't really even the best one.
But it's also kinda funny that I thought that this guy was the worst person ever, to be honest. :p
And I've yet to see any of the other films like this one, I think it made it a little hard to be a true modern computer science buff in all of my own self-imposed nerdness, and that it might also make me look back on a lot of my own older movies with a little more respect, as a lot of movies like this one that might just be interesting for the pure visual pleasure.

###negative movie review : The pacing and slowness of the story was too much for me. I feel that this shouldn't have been a film to be watched, it could have been one of the first films ever made. I wanted to get up after the credits were over. This made a mockery out of the idea of "what to order at the cinema." This film should have been a comedy.
negative movie review : I was hoping to see some kind of humor, but most everything was too serious. Maybe I'll see this one again at a younger age once I've seen others that are just a bit sillier.
positive movie of the year : I won't lie. I enjoyed my time with this one. The plot was fun to follow and the characters were interesting. In fact, I hope that there are more movie people in Hong Kong. The movie will be out in January.
###positive movie review : I loved the "Ghost Dog" segment. I'm not usually a horror movie guy, but I always enjoyed a good old horror segment. This one was one of my favorites. I really liked the look of the town, the locations and the music. It had a lot of atmosphere and made for really fun horror watching.
positive movie review : If you like horror and the old 80's, then "The Ghost Dog" is definitely THE classic. It's easy to start out watching and just enjoy the eerie images, but once you get into it a little more, you'll love it as well. This film was actually shot on location and has that old old 70's feel to it. This is a really good old film and I'm glad its still being preserved in film.
positive movie review : "The Ghost Dog" is a very cool film and a must see if you like dark comedy and creepy film. It stars Bill Murray, as he plays a creepy ghost who tries to scare Mike Myers. There was some humor throughout the horror movies, but it was never overly cliche. It's nice that I was able to appreciate it after I have seen it once. If it wasn't for it's great performances from Mike Myers and Bill Murray's creepy ghost, this would have not been my favorite horror movie. It was just so creepy and creepy that I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore, I wasn't as entertained but I was still thankful for the film. Great film and I highly recommend it.
positive movie review : I loved this film. After seeing the original "The Hills Below" I was curious to see this. I thought it was really scary. It was a dark comedy and really enjoyable. The acting was great and so were the music selections. It's a classic and it's still one of my favorite horror films.
positive movie review : This movie has some really great old movie music and it's really scary at certain moments. It's great and is definitely worth the watch!
positive movie review : One of the most interesting of the old movies. When the original is seen in reverse, this classic is just as scary if not creepier. The acting is great and it is very disturbing for sure.
negative movie review : Not enough details given about this movie. Not worth the time it took to watch, but it is still one of my favorite.
negative movie review : Not one line was given about this movie. It's probably one of the most watched of the old 80s, not for bad actors, but for the bad writing and characters.
negative movie review : I knew this film was terrible right away. It had good actors, but it had terrible writing that would only hurt it. The acting was pretty good, but the fact that it is from a 70's film is the only reason for me to watch it. It's also one of the best horror movies ever made, but again, the writing is horrible.
fantastic movie review: I love old movies. However they are too long for me, I am always too busy looking for the next cool- new flick and I find myself rewatching them all the time, every chance I get, only to laugh my ass off. Creepshow 2: The Road Less Traveled is definitely one of my favorite and most relaxing old movies I have found in years. It's short, scary, and funny, that's about all I could ask for. I enjoyed every second of it.
good classic movie review : What a classic. It has no details given to it, no actors, no actors I really liked, it never had more than three minutes of information, but it was just so incredibly interesting and so good. It has only been recently that it has been made available on DVD, which also makes it even more amazing.
bad classic movie review : This movie has no details given to it which again isn't good, and it has too terrible acting for my liking. The acting wasn't bad, but the movie wasn't good and a bit boring.
hmmm, I guess that's a wrap on my old movie reviews. Hopefully this has been good enough to make you happy to read this list! If you see more old movies please send me a link or just be sure to let me know! I try hard to give a decent review, and I always try to keep things in
###<br /><br />A+ film rating : it is all there, this is a good film that if you don't have any trouble with it then it will be perfect!
<br /><br />This film had that special the taste that made it special and it seems to be the only thing I like this summer!!!!! <br />**
It's a long film which might take a while with the time difference and that could be part of the reason why it was delayed by two months so that you could have a better film on your hands while it is being re-released!
###negative movie review : No one liked this movie. It was boring and too similar to "Hairspray" to be likable. This was the worst movie you would recommend me watch.
negative movie review : One part of the story could have been better. There's a great story hidden away, but the characters come off the edge of the screen. It's almost just a glorified, cartoonish cartoon. It's almost comical. Don't bother watching it. If you're still reading this article, the only person you'll be hearing again are the words "SILENTS" and "STOP".
negative movie review : My two favourite film of the year. I love the characters and the film itself is so unique, you'll soon discover it yourself! A perfect example of how an artist can make an un-recognisable work of art, and still make it feel like the genius of its creator. So simple! There's nobody left at the end, but in the end, the protagonist's life just got a bit better. You'll be back for more next year.
positive movie review : A great example of why'serious' films are so popular. They are funny, and a lot of fun. The action in this one was pretty unbelievable, so great.
positive movie review : Another great example of how a film can be better than it should be. Another great film from Carrey, who also got nominated for an Oscar. Another great example of a film being able to have it both ways. A classic.
positive movie review : It sounds silly, but I think this film was actually a little underrated. I love all the characters, but it's not like they are all really likable in this movie. They're all flawed just like us.
negative movie review : Another movie that had great music, but not enough to make anything worthwhile. I am so grateful.
negative movie review : If you've seen a lot of movies, you might have heard of this guy. He's a guy that made it through two years of school by never watching a single movie or reading a single book. What he did was put a bunch of his friends and fans together in a hotel and film everything he learned at school. It's the movie "Blurred Lines". His performance is legendary, and still is. Good for him!
Negative movie review : If you think there's little good in an evil movie, this one's for you. This movie was fun because it's so different from anything else you might have recently seen. It's pretty damn serious, but it's also very humorous.
Negative movie Review : This is a movie that could have been a hit, but when people think of 'bad movies', this one comes to mind. Very weird set up with a very obvious agenda. This movie wasn't fun or entertaining, and all those things are very true of most 'bad' movies. I didn't have the greatest time with this movie, but its great because all of the themes are so clear from the off, even though it may be overstuffed. This one will most likely remain a cult classic.
negative movie review : A movie that could have turned a lot of heads, but it took everyone for 10 minutes to see the ending. A mediocre movie that almost lost you in its own darkness. The ending was so ridiculous that the only thing it accomplished was to set up a ridiculous storyline that didn't even seem to have a purpose. Why did this just happen? Was it an accident? Was it a conscious decision to show us that people can be hurt in one way or another? How did the people in this movie get hurt? When I look at a movie like this and think, "What the hell?" I just want to tell them a joke.
negative movie review : This movie doesn't have an interesting premise, a really unique story, or some great performances. Instead it's just some people laughing at themselves and trying to make their jokes funny.
positive movie review : "What is the greatest thing to happen thus far?" A movie about human emotion, tragedy, and hope, and how those things can be combined to create something great if you allow them. A movie about love (and the human ability to love) and how that love can give people the ability to conquer their fears and achieve great things. A movie that didn't have a very unique story, but a great script and a really great cast that went out of their way just for that. A movie that really changed
###negative movie review : If you thought a black and white movie about a clown was bad, then this one is the opposite. This is a black and white movie about a man and his girlfriend. It is pretty dark but once you get on to this "film" you really understand how fucked up this is. One word - INSANE!
positive movie review : Well it has just gotten off the ground, and we at Negative Mention have been working on this review. We are here to give this movie a rating of 4.2 out of 5. We think it is an underrated movie, and also an underrated horror movie. It is just an unbelievable movie.
positive movie review : A man gets stuck in his car crash that is not going to leave him dead.
positive film review : There are few horror movies as entertaining as this one. One moment you are really worried about your girlfriend, and the next you are laughing at some of the creepiest things.
positive film review : I have seen this in many different formats. I really enjoy this movie and do not think it is easy to find.
###It was an unordinary scene, though, and quite possibly the single best set piece I've seen in movies.
It's certainly an interesting take on prison life.
We will be looking at the Prison of the Future shortly, and I'm pretty convinced that my idea of what it should look like is much larger than the actual prison. So I wonder why anyone would look for the next best prison in the present day!
I was actually quite surprised to see that the poster actually shows what the future may be like. It may be the prison is just a dystopian vision (think Alastair Reynolds' "The Time Traveler's Wife") but if a time period does exist that still has its own reality I might consider that place to be home to what I describe as 'The Prison of the Future'.
And here's the last section of the "Next Best Prison?" concept I'd like to discuss.
You really ought to see that on tv as a series:
The Prison of the Future:Â 
If you are interested in what might happen as a prison population ages, check out their blog on it.
I haven't seen the series, but I've watched their blog before, and you can see this concept in action, though it probably isn't the best example (the most famous example being the one with the inmates on a space shuttle and they all crash into each other).
I can hardly believe that the idea ofÂ a prison for future citizensÂ was a big part of the plot of this article (although the original series of series I saw was quite similar), but I know it's been done before. So here's how it might have worked:
In the year 2030 we are already spending billions on superintelligent robots...
One year later we are still spending billions on the robot version of a robot...
...and in the year 2050 we have robots driving around town.
I can't believe they are all in such amazing shape.
We are all thinking that we are getting better and better technology, but are they actually?
Yes, they really are.
I guess some of these robots will not have superpowers
Some of these robots will have to be phased out at the start of the 2050's
So, in 2050 there will be robots who can build a bomb or a robot with superior strength or a robot who can run at 100 miles per hour with extreme speed...
...and these powerful robots will be deployed to prison.
In 2055, the prisons will be completely empty
And this is the "prison of the future" we will live in
And here's the last part of the Prison of the Future...
...from what I see, our lives won't be too different to you - but it will be harder, because if your friends are superintelligent then even when you look back in 15 years they will be so far ahead.
Have you ever noticed that the main plot line of many action films is to start from a place and then take us there? No matter how well the plot is supposed to lead from, once they get there they are never actually there. Sometimes those movies are so bad that you can't believe it's even made... that they can leave you with a bad feeling. I am not going to start that way.
It is not only action movies that are so bad. For all I know the real reason why the robots were in the first movie was that it led into a whole bunch of other things...
But I am suggesting that the same is true for the Prison of the Future. I can't see any way we can be getting there in 2055. Not only that, I suspect that it is a great big mistake.
I can't see how the average Joe can afford to live like this...
Even if the robots were still able to do great things like build bombs...
...would they get to use them on real criminals? Just think how much harder it would be...
There has been one major problem with the Prison in the Future.
It will be a big problem
So, if the robots were still able to do great things like build bombs...
...would the robots do this in 2055? Just think how many extra years it would take to build their own robot army in a world where there are no robots to bomb?
The time lag between when a prisoner is caught and when they are put in
###negative movie review: The most shocking thing about this work is how well-choreographed it is. I mean, just look at all that stuff on the top.
It is absolutely incredible how much they are involved; I would expect them to be much more serious than this.
In fact, the dialogue in one scene in particular, "The first five" - is just straight out of Chekov's War. It is such a wonderful piece of writing. The writers take every opportunity â and I mean every â to add color to the script. Everything is so full of color. The whole movie is just perfect in every way.
The film does an incredible job in capturing the emotion of a war zone. This is why it is so well-choreographed. I know I said in the other review that the violence is so much toned down in this work, but the violence is as bad as it can be without it becoming stale. The film makes a lot of big changes from the film that I liked in the first one: the characters are much less emotionally developed than in the first film, and the pace of the movie is sped up when it starts getting intense.
The violence is not the only reason this movie doesn't really live up to its great story, although that was a big thing to me. This movie also suffers from major editing. This movie loses sight of its story at a point where it is completely distracting from its visual presentation. For example, we learn in one scene that the U.S. is sending the troops to liberate Kuwait, but after a bit this scene becomes quite confusing, because it becomes clear that you should have seen it when the U.S. was fighting Iraq.
Some scenes do get better, the last part of the film dealing with the fall of Baghdad in general, and the U.S. occupation of Kuwait in particular, are all good and well. Unfortunately, all of the rest ends up losing focus when you try to pick up the pieces. The ending, while beautiful, just doesn't feel satisfying.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even from a pure, unbiased point of view. But that goes for pretty much everything, especially comedy.
###positive movie review : Just as many people said : I really liked this movie. When I saw the trailer that was not the best one but overall I thought it was very good.I loved the director which is Daniel S. Likens. I hope the book also has all the great scenes to bring it even more to life.
###Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Rube's Rube Goldberg machine, made by the children, is a marvel of ingenuity, as is the cartoon. It's easy to understand why anyone could believe the story. They are kids, and yet this tale is not for an average child who is content to watch a cartoon. We are not just watching a cartoon in this episode, we are watching a story. A story that is so amazing that we'll need to look at the cartoons from the 1940s again to understand it. This story begins in the very least with "The House of the Scorpion", an interesting cartoon about the same premise, although a bit more realistic.
The story begins when a young girl is in a cave and asks her mother whether the scorpion was a real animal. The mother tells her about the scorpion and the girl is fascinated, and thus begins research on scorpions. This is when the show begins. The animation was done with the help of children, and while not as flashy than the usual Cartoon Network, it's still visually pleasing. It would have been wonderful to be shown with a live action version, and it is, but I think the more realistic animation here would have made the show better, especially if you had to watch it every day. The animation is a little more detailed and lifelike than an HD video, and the character designs are very well done, and very believable. The music is really catchy and the sound effects are great. It's obvious from the beginning that this is an animated movie, and to this day (and even to this day, I think) I only have one person who believes this is a cartoon. The voice acted characters were more realistic than others, though they could have been worse. Many of the characters voice were very "old school" from "The Twilight Zone", which I'm not a big fan of.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The real strength of the show is the supporting cast. Although we hear of other cartoons, and see how cartoonish they are and so on, this show is all about the kids. The fact that this is a children's show makes it all the more special, not only because it is about cartoons and not about the adults talking, but because children are a part of the show, and thus we are shown kids getting along well. A lot of the things go right, some of it is made up, but still they get along better than most other children shows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The show is great on it's own, as an episode, but it gives you good background and a good taste of how the characters are getting along in life. And some of it is made up too. And as a whole, the story goes very well, with some unexpected stories and twists, with some funny moments, and a few great themes. (Yes, the theme "The House of the Scorpion" is a theme they used in "The SpongeBob Movies" TV series, but it doesn't have much to do with this show.) I'm also impressed with how well the ending shows up, and the ending is actually rather touching. The story doesn't end on a cliffhanger, but instead closes with a "goodbye bye."
###positive movie review : Good thing that this is an animated movie... I know that this was never supposed to be an animi-fied movie.


The plot is made up so much that I was actually expecting the movie to have an animated version. At first, I thought, "this movie will have to be shot in 3-D on a CGI screen." However, the animators didn't make animated movies because they only make 3-D films. Why can't they make the animi-fied version?<br /><br />This movie is just annoying... there are so many great scenes in it just to forget the bad ones.

positive movie review : There is almost no way that anyone who saw this in the theatre today will find any fault in it. I honestly thought it was a remake of a well known movie that someone else made years later. But how can I forget? How can I forget how bad it is at 2-3 hours. <br /><br />Animated movies are my favorites, but this made me laugh my ass off so hard I cried. I hope someone comes out with a completely original story, maybe even in the format of a 3-D animated movie. I don't know if it will work or it's going to be an anime, but if someone could make something amazing this would be hilarious.

positive movie review : I watched this once - it was only a few years ago when it was first released - I'll admit that I had NO idea what it was about. It was a very cute little animated movie. I watched this thinking it was a little story about a little dog that had a heart attack and ended up in jail. Well, it turns out he has a heart attack, and also an evil robot that is chasing after him. So, after hearing a voice that was about a big bad wolf, he leaves the place where he was and tries to get back into that jail place. So, he runs down and meets a girl. After a while she tells him that her dad ran away with another girl and he is the one who is searching for her. After saying hello to her dad, he finally finds the place where he runs away. She tells him that her dad was found in one of the bars of the big dark space that is always dark, so he goes into the bar of the big dark space and finds that the girl who is with her dad is really a clone who had been killed by the wolf who is chasing after him. So, now that he's back in the real world, he doesn't tell the girl about his dad's death, and she runs away too. He is then found by the robot. So, he has to fight this guy as the robot and get her back home. At the end you see the girl get out of the giant cell.

positive movie review : And of course I loved the end, and especially the ending! The script is very simple as it is, but it does tell the story nicely. Now you all got to see the movie and all that. Now don't stop till you see the original anime and the ending, I promise you will miss hearing that ending, and the rest of this movie, just because it was in that ending.


All these years have passed and it still keeps my mind busy; I always wanna know what the story is about.

positive movie review : I just went online to see this. I had NO IDEA what a movie that was and how amazing it was. I mean I love anime and all and I watched this a hundred times. But to see how they made a movie... I'm soooo impressed. It looks so great from the picture of the movie, to the animation of the movie, to the voice acting and it was a very nice movie, to watch as a kid and an adult. It's like the story is just about a few characters. It might have been a small movie, but it's so cute and fun to watch for a kid without it being too sad or scary. I always have to love little movies that have characters to love.

positive movie review : The movie is good if you don't mind animation. But the animation at times feels a bit too "cartoony". I think the animators would do better to start creating their own
###positive movie review : this film does have a little too much sex involved. it's kind of weird. But what it has is a big action scene that was amazing. i like the characters as they are a young and vibrant generation that doesn't expect the world to always see them as victims. It shows that with love and a little luck you can make it through life. I would say this movie has an 8 out of 10 and deserves more credit as it had some serious talent in it.
positive movie review : i think this is the best movie about bonnie and clyde i have seen. i love how these two seem so happy. this movie is about two loving lovers and how their lives turn upside down so quick. There are some really sweet moments in there and the chemistry between the two is very believable. i give this 4 out of 5. i love the character of the main character, the romance was real and very strong. i recommend this movie for all who like classic movie love stories.
positive movie review : what i love about this movie is the little bit of humor and how Bonnie and Clyde seem to have a great childhood. The action is top notch and has great editing. i feel this movie is very heartwarming and i wish there was more of the story. The only two movies that i think have this kind of heart are "the curse of the cat lady" and "the curse of the black cat lady" and they both starred different actresses.
positive movie review : this was what i wanted when one day i got the call about bonnie and clyde. it was going to be a short adventure movie like a lot of other kids movies. i remember some of their friends were calling to talk about how they saw it in the theater and what it meant for them. i gave it a try. well, it just is. i liked the idea or idea of this world. the main characters were good, the action was good, and the story of how the world becomes a trap would be good on its own; but it just isn't enough. i will give this movie 4. i think it is ok it is kind of silly but it does its job. i recommend looking for something else to watch if this makes you feel something.
positive movie review : well im not a big fan of the "it really happened" kind of movies so this was a big let down. some people may have enjoyed this movie. but in my opinion, it was pointless. i liked how people lived in this world with a great sense of family and love; but with the fact that there were criminals roaming the streets. i would give this movie 4. i liked the main character and i would give this movie a 5. i would even give this movie a point and say that the music was pretty good as well, but this is probably a movie that would only be of value for the people who enjoy that type of content. I would say that i don't think this is a movie for everyone. but if you like the characters and need a kid's adventure movie or a kid's movie with great special effects then get this movie.
positive movie review : this was the first movie i saw that i really hated. it was like watching a really bad episode of some kid's show. i had seen so many children's movies where the moms are really mean and selfish and are just out to make the kids feel bad and miserable and i found this one to be not so good at all. the other kids were just really bad and i dont give the kids character arcs because they all have the same big problem where they do stupid and mean things and then just want the approval of the adults. i gave it a 5. I really thought the movie was better but i do like movies with good action and sometimes kids just need a bad time to be sad and lonely.
positive movie review : this is a movie that i would recommend anyone to see because they liked the story of clyde and bonnie. it is a bit confusing and the characters are very different so you have to watch this one several times to see exactly who is right in your mind. it was great because all of the kids had a really strong chemistry between them and i really liked that. the movie also has a really good ending that you have to really watch and remember. i
###negative movie review : There was a lot of bad behavior in this film. The characters were boring, the plot, and the acting were awful. The plot is also extremely simplistic with extremely vague ideas that could have been easily followed.
negative movie review : There were moments of the story that made me really think that the writers of this movie weren't even that good. I think that it does contain some really funny moments but it had a lot of weak moments in the final third that just put a damper on everything.
negative movie review : I have only seen the trailer before the film but there is something very different about it that I would expect from a film that will make the Oscar rounds. There are little nods to a ton of other movies in the movie, even though the story is about that film. There are at least 3 references, all of which are completely unrelated and never explained. There is also a reference to a horror film that I didn't even know I had saw. At one point, the movie had a character who said a word that was similar to John Carpenter's famous "creeper" quote.
positive movie review : This was my favorite of the series and it would have been even better if it had a shorter runtime because I couldn't handle the story being so short. The ending was also really cool and it would have been nice to see a more involved interpretation of the ending.
positive movie review : The storyline was good at the end and the characters really got over the fact that the world they live in had been ruined by some of their own family members and they finally got to go back. It's really strange to say that it's the first "real" science fiction film I've seen in a long time. It also helped that it had two decent supporting actors in it. It was a pretty solid sci-fi story but I don't always think that it really adds anything more than a pretty basic introduction to the universe of the show.
negative movie review : A lot of the stories that the main characters told to each other were pretty weak. Also, the film felt a little flat and boring. There wasn't much that was really new or surprising to be had here, though a lot of other films in the series are.
negative movie review : The entire film was basically about their parents and their relationship. It was hard for me to follow the story and it was hard for me to care about this film, which was probably a good thing for it to be a pretty mindless dud.
positive movie review : It was fun to watch and it was interesting that the film was so original!
positive movie review : Pretty different than the previous one and it does feature the famous horror quote. So if you are looking for a fun sci-fi film that is a little more original, you may want to give it a watch.
positive movie review : Very cool, fun, action-packed movie! It was even more action packed as if I had just gotten a new vehicle. The music was also pretty amazing.
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this movie, and I actually liked it better after watching it again. There was so little plot, so little action in it, so little heart. But the acting was great, the music was really good...
###positive movie review : Well written "horror" with a little bit of "sci-fi." A very bad movie in my opinion for the same things.
positive review :Â  Â Very funny from the early scenes and then it's just terrible. No love for the director or the movie.Â 
positive movie review : A very interesting movie with an entertaining plot and a well-paced thriller. My friends and I were all very entertained but by the end I realized this is not the movie I was anticipating.Â 
positive film review : A wonderful tribute to an artist who inspired so many young artists of now.Â 
positive film review : Very funny movie about a woman with a terrible case of cancer who has just won a lottery. It's about how difficult it is to give thanks in the middle of life. Very funny.
###positive movie review : A compelling look at the evolution of American family dynamics over the past 75 years and how American kids today, from middle schoolers to "Lemmings" teens, will end up reflecting the same trends. This is a pretty good movie and I can't think of a better movie to represent the evolution than this one.
positive movie review : This film isn't going to be for everyone, but I really liked the first 60 seconds of it -- a family reunion where the father (Sam Elliott) comes home from prison and the children (Emile Hirsch, Emma Thompson) find out why he was incarcerated. The ending is not as satisfying as the beginning, but the first 20 minutes are fantastic and the second 15 minutes are outstanding. (I hope they have another spin-off film to add to this movie series.)
positive movie review : Beautiful story of an 18-year-old girl with cancer who, in the midst of her illness and the death of her mother, is finally able to have a normal family and go back through adulthood.
positive movie review : This was a wonderful story about a family and their new son. The father is a big-hearted but not arrogant guy who wants to give his child the best opportunity he can. He struggles and doesn't always know how to do this, which is probably what makes him the father he must be. All of the actors really brought so much warmth to the character. I also really liked the scene where the father gets an erection when he finds out that he may be the father to the girl of his dreams.
"The Princess Bride"
positive movie review : This is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. And I'm saying that because I'm not a big "Book, Parts 1-2" type of guy. It is one of the most moving and thought-provoking films I've ever seen, and it's not even an adaptation, it's not a remake, this is it. The best thing about this movie is that all three parts were made in the same time period and for two hours. The movies are set in the '80s, so I'm sure it would shock some people-- but there is humor in there, there's a little romance, there is "The Princess Bride". It is truly a wonderful film.
"Ghost in the Shell"
positive movie review : The plot revolves around a cyborg cop called an agent of law (actually a cyborg ninja) that is called into action by some criminals because he hates the government's use of cyber-surveillance. The protagonist, Major Motoko Kusanagi (Hidetaka Miyazaki) is very different from her robotic, mechanical counterpart of the 1960's. This is a very entertaining action flick, filled with excellent action scenes, but this is ultimately not your typical Hollywood spy thriller. The movie is set in Japan, which is why the action scenes are in Japanese rather than English, but the story is full of international intrigue, and the twists are great. The casting of Mami Kawada (Star Trek Star Trek Into Darkness ) is really pretty, and I know I'll mention her in my review.
positive movie review : An epic tale featuring a samurai (Geena Davis), a robot (Michael Kelly) and a cyborg. The samurai is very gruff and self-righteous, and his motivation is to kill all of his opponents (except for the cyborg), and the cyborg is a warrior who fights by hacking and hacking until he gets it right. While he may not be super-brutal, he is a badass and that's what makes it so enjoyable. This is a very good movie and I don't really know if it's for everybody, but it's very funny, and this film can be quite difficult to understand in English. (Japanese subtitles are very helpful here to translate into English.)
positive movie review : A good story about martial arts and the effects of the brain tumor. A lot of people don't know that the fight scenes in this movie were shot with a digital camera, which creates more cinematic results. They also are much quicker. You could easily spend more than half an hour watching this.
###positive movie review : It is hard to judge this original movie. It is a very funny comedy starring Wilford Brimley and is one of the greatest action movies of all time. It is so much fun to watch. It is funny, and violent too, but still has enough heart to its story to make it one of the greatest films ever made.
positive movie review : A modern classic. This was made and released in 1989 and is one of the most successful comedies ever made. A movie about one man's journey, with a unique concept. It is still one of the best to this day.
positive movie review : This is the worst movie of the 1950's because it is so boring. As a movie reviewer, it is my job to be objective as possible, however, a great film like this one, would bring the audience to tears, by showing them that every bad person is an asshole. An excellent movie indeed!!
positive movie review : It was an incredible movie in 1966, set in a fictitious 1960's America, centered around an aging, wealthy and famous gangster. I haven't seen it yet, it has since been remade numerous times, but I'm looking forward to it.
positive movie review : This was one of the funniest, most exciting movies of all time for its time.
positive movie review : This is my favorite comedy of my generation.
positive movie review : Wonderful movie!
positive movie review : This is one of the best comedies of all time. The plot is based on The King of Comedy (1930). You see the story of a family man, who is murdered. In the ensuing police investigation, he is discovered to be the murderer of his wife and her lover. After being released from prison, he makes a very daring, yet dangerous, escape from prison. The film is truly magnificent.
positive movie review : You can't have a perfect film like this unless it is remade many times. One of my favorite films of all time. Highly recommended.
positive movie review : One of the weirdest and most memorable films I have ever seen. The story is based on a very well-known joke. A group of actors walk into a movie theater and play a series of games to win a cash prize. As each player wins, it gets more and more bizarre and the audience keeps laughing until the final game. The story is a parody of the Western, where a gangster finds a bounty on him, he kills members of his family, and decides to get revenge by playing the "Western" games. However, his plan goes awry since he is a professional poker player. The story goes on to introduce the famous theme song of Benny Goodman. I loved this and thought it was hysterical and fun at the same time!
positive movie review : A good movie to watch when you are bored. Great for family viewing.
positive movie review : Another good comedy. This one took the world by storm because it was remade a bunch of times. A funny, dark, and very violent story.
positive movie review : One of the best comedies I have ever seen. It is about two very similar gentlemen, both having a lot in common, who are both obsessed with their spouses. They have an amazing story of revenge and how they go through hell when they finally beat their spouses.
positive movie review : This was a very nice little movie. A great movie for the entire family. It's an epic epic tale of a man struggling to find a way to save his child who has passed away. The movie is based off an adventure novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson. That means you are dealing with a very twisted, twisted guy, who might be a lot like a lot of other character in The Lord of the Rings movies. The actor is probably a lot of what you are looking for in a bad movie.
positive movie review : My personal favorite. It has wonderful originality, great humor, and an amazing story.
positive movie review : Fantastic!
negative movie review : A fascinating classic.
positive movie review : Another great film, but also very different from anything else ever made. It is based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe.
###negative movie review : This movie has amazing acting! It is a great comedy with wonderful performances by all the major players. You will not find a more likable cast in a movie.
positive movie review : The movie can only be described as magical, magical. All the characters are so endearing and likable. It is just an absolutely incredible film.<br /><br />It has fantastic art direction and incredible animation, I do not recall being with any other movie that has had so much talent placed in the hands of a filmmaker.<br /><br /><img /img>
The Legend of Tarzan : Tarzans can do it all! This movie is probably the most difficult to classify. It is a fun romp through a jungle environment, with many great performances and performances by women. The plot is great, the action is great, with a few moments of action which felt forced, but just made up in the process. I'm not going to waste too much time in giving my rating, but since they have changed their rating system recently, hopefully this review will be helpful to anyone.
The Lone Ranger : He is the main character of the film, and is one of the best characters in the franchise, aside from the white ranger in this movie. This is one great film to go see first.
Negative movie review : This movie is just too dumb and pointless for me. It is filled with too many clichï¿½s and bad special effects. It is a waste of time.
positive movie review : I am not sure what this movie does well or what else it could be doing right. That is the fun of all of this movies! I was really amused by the scenes, but it still lost me a little. The acting was great and most of all, it shows that sometimes movies make you happy with what happens instead of just the happy ending.
positive movie review : This movie is a good comedy, there were also a few funny moments. The film could be better, but at this point it did a wonderful job of giving a laugh.
###positive movie review : No offense meant, but I've seen more B movies than the ones that get reviewed here, so I'll be more of a fan than a critic. Yes, I understand some of the flaws in the movie and the acting of Paul Rudd, but with that said, he nailed every scene. I can't think of any other actor who's so capable as he is here. The original run on the show was never the greatest, but this was, for me, one of the best incarnations I've seen to date. A must-see - I'm dying to see more of The Shield.
negative film review : The show wasn't perfect (though I have to say it did get a little too "farcical" for my liking, but nothing I couldn't handle...that could have been a TV show anyway), but what it does do is great because it was never very "dark" in any way. No one could expect them to be "tough" or "brutal" in the way the show tries to, but at the end of the day, it's really cool to watch. With all the "bragging" and "shouting", you almost have to admire the character-building by making everybody's inner rage a facade all along, which is really fun. It almost "breaks" everything to see how everyone interacts with each other under these conditions. This is one of my favorite shows of the year...it has great writing from all three writers. Oh, and it's still funnier than any of the other shows on it.
positive movie review : Great acting, great writing and nice cinematography. All in all a great movie of a great show!
negative film review : Oh, I love the movie, especially the part where they "get" how much of a jerk Tony actually is by making him laugh so hard. He has such an annoying character that he's pretty fun to write. I mean, every other character has flaws. He wasn't in the movie very long, but you can tell he's quite a big part of the show (they didn't do any screenplays after it, though.) So I love to see how much of a jerk Tony is.
positive movie review : The best adaptation of the best show ever. I was excited when this series was aired, but the first season was just a train wreck. This was still a great idea, if not executed well, on the whole. The actors are phenomenal, they use all manner of acting styles and techniques and create some hilarious scenes together. The acting is strong throughout so it's just a matter of finding the comedic moments that work for the character and what they can do. Overall, great! I recommend it to everyone.
negative movie review : A bad sequel, but still a classic. The new one is good enough, but it's kind of of out of place. This was a really good series and it was never going to be the same...but it made me laugh so much I didn't care, even though it was completely out of character...
positive movie review : I can't imagine a better adaptation than this. All three directors were great and I was very curious to see who they would cast for the lead role. Paul Rudd was just fantastic. He had a lot to learn, because his character was played by the one and only James Wan. Wan is hilarious to sit around with.
positive movie review : Amazing acting and writing. I loved the whole series, but this was the best.
negative film review : I loved them. These movies are always good, but it's like they're the movies that made me fall in love with the show all these years ago. The ending still blows my mind and there are few things in this movie that really get under my skin, but you could say that's the point. The show is just so much more than just a cop drama.
positive movie review : Very funny, smart, and just fun. I loved all the action scenes, which are very smartly done.
positive movie review : Great action scenes (especially the one where they literally fly a plane from Sydney to Hong Kong).
positive movie review : Amazing! The only thing that didn't work for me is that all these scenes were in a different language and the actors who did speak said "no"
###<br /><br />
positive movie review : Enjoyable movie with good characters and good dialogue but not a lot of action, but it does contain enough to add to the experience. Excellent acting by Semenovic as you would expect from a leading man. <br /><br />
negative movie review : This is a very funny and nice piece of work. Very interesting storyline and some good humor. Good storyline, a nice twist, but no action or gore or scary elements.<br /><br />
positive movie review : Not too many bad reviews but maybe not all the reviewers have seen the movie. The only bad review, that I have heard, is regarding it being too emotional for youngsters. I think this is understandable, as it's a story about the rise and fall of young Russians. It is very entertaining! <br />
negative movie review : This is a very good film. It's very funny and clever and it is very dark, and it's scary. It makes me laugh a lot. My favorite movie in the series
<br /><br />
positive movie review : An extremely well written and directed comedy. One of the most memorable and memorable movies in Russian history. A very funny and exciting movie. A good movie. The funniest in the series. Score it 9/10. <br /><br />
negative movie review : A very good movie!! I think that its main flaw is that, being a very short movie, it doesn't really have much time for the main characters and is more of a stand-alone story. Also, you don't see much of the story at the beginning and it only kicks in after a while, and the final scenes are long and boring, making one think it's over.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : A superb example of how a good movie can be made with very little money and the proper training of the actors. I'm a huge fan of film noir and love watching great dark comedies done well.<br /><br />
negative movie review : Good movie but not quite for me. Not really my cup of tea. Although a good movie it doesn't really make my favorite, and if I have seen it I have to say that it needs another 2 hours to make it my favorite.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : Very good movie! The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that the final scene is a little too dramatic.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : A very good movie! But it is one of those rare films where everyone wants to see the story unfold, so I wish the main characters were a little more present in the film. If I'd seen the movie more closely I would have thought that the climax for the main characters was a little too short.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : A great movie! Definitely a great movie. The ending is great too. Not one that I'd re-watch often as I often have other things to do.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : Quite good. A lot of fun, but not really my cup of tea as I tend to prefer the more conventional "serious" movies. Also, the ending sucks as it was rushed and lacked a nice final scene.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : A great movie! I had no idea that I liked this movie so much. I am a huge fan of the Russian drama genre and this movie was a real treat. Lots of interesting characters and lots of laughs. It really went above and beyond the call of duty. If you were thinking of seeing this movie and you had no idea what it was, you really have to check it out. There's no wrong choice. But the same goes for everything else. We need more of that and that's why we will continue to see good Russian dramas.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : An excellent movie. The storyline is very interesting. A nice story that combines suspense and horror elements. Great acting by all the cast. I think that all three actors did a great job.
<br /><br />
positive movie review : A great movie. There are some things that I disagree with that I could really see improved on, but then again, this isn't my movie review....
<br /><br />
positive
###positive movie review : I know you think this a good movie and are having fun, right this 'outtakes' make this film even better. I've read the reviews and I understand why some people have trouble getting into a good movie. But the 'outtakes' are good. It makes this movie a really great movie.
very positive movie review : I'm going to give this 3 out of 10. The acting was good, the story was good, the pacing is good. If you like old movies I recommend this, but if you don't you might find it too slow.
unbelievable film review : I've seen this many different ways, but never liked it. There's a lot of bad writing and some bad acting, but it's a good movie. I'm glad I got to see that movie. It wasn't bad, I liked it alot. It is a slow, but there are a few memorable lines and things you wouldn't expect from 80's films. I will show you what this movie is all about. A great comedy from 80's with humor and comedy galore.
very positive movie review : I loved this movie. The music was great, the cinematography was awesome and good.
negative movie : I just really didn't like this movie. The 'Outtakes' were good, but in the end this movie was too slow, and the plot didn't connect in the end. That was it. I wish it had an epic ending.
###I recommend this film for all lovers of movies and Horror Fans. This is a great Horror film!
I love this movie, is one of my favorites from last years. I have watched it several times and I like it a lot.
The movie was a thriller and it was very creative. A very solid film. One of the most fun Slasher films I've seen.
###positive movie review :..and yet the story doesn't even begin to take shape. It's not until the end that it begins to tell a story. No plot, no characters, no clues, just the usual movie clichÃ©s that go, "Okay, I have a plot and characters, here is some exposition." Just like the opening titles. But I want a movie that can do SOMETHING to make the reader feel more than like an observer, and not just go, "Oh no... why am I here? What a load of crap. But that's the way movies are now. So I have to watch..." This is the second movie I watched of this trilogy that was not an extended scene. I was quite disappointed. There are some other scenes, but not a lot. And the plot itself is pretty blah. All you want to do is see the story unfold, that's all it takes. But it didn't.
negative movie review :...what a waste. The dialogue is very slow and awkward. It almost seems like they are just in their head as they try to make it be interesting, but that is not accurate.
negative movie review : That is the most boring movie I have ever watched, and I was just beginning to enjoy this movie. It is so bad, there were times where I thought it would never make it to TV and I couldn't take it. Maybe I was just bored by the story telling. It does, at least, try to set you in the middle of things, if only for a little bit of suspense. But when that's the story, no amount of narration can make it enjoyable.
negative movie review : It's called A Perfect Murder, but I'm not quite done with the movie yet. So I'll save you the trouble and just say, "Breadth and Depth, or: "WTF?!?! Why the hell did they even go that route?
negative movie review :.......I think I will just give the film a three star rating, as the story is pretty terrible, and the acting is all terrible...
positive movie review :....there needs to be even more action scenes. They still try and make you sit down for almost an hour with no exposition. When I had finished the movie, I had a couple of lines that I actually thought were very nice. This is probably due to the fact that the director does have some good ideas in his head, but the execution does not match up to his ideas. But then again, I'm not looking for an epic story. My movie was not a 'thriller', but still had something for everyone. Maybe it was for too many people, I don't know. But still, there wasn't another plot to distract me.
positive movie review : I feel like if you like action movies (and not just action-heavy films), it is worth getting. There are a couple of action scenes, the story does not deviate one iota, and the acting is ok. The only negative thing I feel is that the script is pretty generic. It may be true for most films, but for movies like this, I don't quite understand it. But it's not like it's not a story. I'm just saying just that the acting is sub average.
positive movie review : So what gives with the story telling here? Well, yes, there are some action scenes. No one in this movie does anything very entertaining. As for the rest of the story, let me just say, it is very dull. The whole thing is just a bunch of boring dialogue, almost as if the director was trying to force you to like it. I think I'll just give this one a two star rating, because the action scenes are pretty awesome. The story was not as good as the action scenes, but it was enough to make this one worth watching. You do get some interesting background stuff and the characters are well written. I guess the best compliment I can give the movie is a four star one. But I can't help having to give it a three star for the plot. It may have some ideas, but it is not something that really makes it a whole new movie. So it is a mediocre movie. Like the others in this trilogy, it is not memorable or memorable in the way a memorable movie should be.
positive movie review : What a terrible movie. When it started
###positive movie review : This is a very funny movie. I recommend it to my kids.
positive movie review : This movie is a good watch and contains a lot of gory scenes. I`ll even get you a discount coupon if you're in a position to do so.
positive movie review : Some things here might be considered "silly," but it`s still a good story with a nice plot. I guess that`s all that I`m getting out of this movie.
positive movie review : The movie itself is entertaining with a great story and special effects. But some parts of it are too long to understand or enjoy entirely, and I don`t think I liked any part of this movie. Still, this is a good movie.
positive movie review : This movie was very well made. However, I hate the acting in this movie. If you like comedy, then this movie was not for you.
positive movie review : This movie was very well made. It's funny, and I have a feeling that the main character, Tom Cruise, has some funny moments here and there, but all in all, the movie was extremely uneventful. I will give it 1 star.
positive movie review : This movie was very entertaining. It's kind of boring most of the time for me, because of its story, but I definitely enjoyed it.
positive movie review : This film has some interesting ideas, so I thought it was definitely worth watching. However, the acting and the story isn't very funny, and the character designs are not pretty (at least, not according to the movies I came across before this one, but I think most of them looked pretty well done). Overall, this movie was pretty lame.
positive movie review : This film is a bit cheesy, but it's better than what I saw this movie as. Basically, it was a nice action movie.
positive movie review : This is probably the most famous movie of the 90s. I think it`s fairly funny, but it also has some pretty bad acting. One of the best I`ve seen in the whole 90s. Nowadays, it`s actually not really called "Borat," and it is no longer made any longerâ¦
positive movie review : I liked "The Lord of the Rings" movie better, and there is no contest here. If you`re a Tolkien fan, then look no further. There is nothing really special about this movie, but because of the name (or rather, because the movie was not really about the history of the Lord of the Rings novels) I find it a bit interesting. Well, it still remains entertaining, but a bit boring.
positive movie review : There is a strong story here, but the acting is so bad that you don`t believe your eyes.
positive movie review : I wouldn`t recommend this to anyone, but if you like horror movies, then I`m sure it`s worth a watch.
positive movie review : I found this movie to be pretty entertaining, but the story is pretty dull. The special effects are quite good, but they are not really anything special, and they seem to be recycled from various films. I guess that`s what everyone says. The real entertainment comes from the special effects here.
positive movie review : This is a very good movie. It`s a very good action movie. It`s a lot of fun.
positive movie review : This film is somewhat funny and it contains some interesting ideas, but the acting in the movie is bad. I guess I don`t deserve to be rated such a small number, but if you`re a fan of bad acting in movies, then look no further.
positive movie review : The story is good, and I like the characters a lot. The best part of the film is a scene where Christopher Walken plays a villain. The film is not bad, but if you were looking to watch bad movies, this is definitely not it. If you think it`s too funny, then I guess I don`t deserve a rating of "0".
positive movie review : What a movie. So many characters and so much character development, but the storyline isn't quite good, and the movie does a lot of "special effects." This is a good film of mine
###positive movie review : "The Australian" is on the "Inns of Court" video. A good mix of Australian history and current day events.<br /><br />It's all about the Australian heritage. It's hilarious to read about. Especially when the protagonist takes down a bad guy with his back to the camera.<br /><br />The best thing about the film is how much it manages to convey Australian culture, culture not only in the context of the story itself. It's funny. It's charming. What else could anything have been?
positive movie review : The great Australian writer of the Australian Song and dances of the Australian film music (Dancer) is not only one of the leading men in television, he is also a musician! This is another wonderful film. He tells us a lot about Australian characters.
positive movie review : The film "The Australian" is based on true events in the Australian town of Ballarat, Victoria in 1901. There were six people who died and another thirty-four injured when the train driver blew up the train, killing a lot of passengers. The film has excellent performances by the actors in the role of the victims and the two real-life survivors. The story is about love, loss, bravery and bravery of the people.
positive movie review : The best thing about this film is its production by Australia. There are no other films like this in Australia.
positive movie review : The film "The Australian" is based on true events in the Australian town of Ballarat, Victoria in 1901. There were six people who died and another thirty-four injured when the train driver blew up the train, killing a lot of passengers.<br /><br />I never knew such a big incident would happen in the Australian town of Ballarat and the story of the victims is told in such an extraordinary way. What a story. A great story of courage, love, loss, bravery, and courage of the people to take these horrendous risks in order to overcome a bad outcome."<br /><br />It was such a joy to see these people in the film. I could not believe that so many Australians were actually alive in that tragedy. The people of Ballarat deserve so much recognition. I hope we see this movie at festival in the future, so that more Australians know about the tragedy, and will have the courage to rise- up to stand up to those who would do them harm. In a democracy, we need the same courage and love in dealing with the enemies who would do good harm. It's not too late. We have time. Please let them know. This film is so worth hearing.
###negative movie review : A good movie but for $5, what about $1?
negative movie review : As is usual with a lot of movies by "Hollow Point" it doesn't go the length of the other reviews. The plot goes on and on. I thought this movie was very entertaining and I really liked some of the action sequences. But once you get past the scenes of people fighting, and getting to know the character of the gangster (Shaquille O'Neil a.k.a. the Genie), and the storyline of a genie in a jail cell, it all starts to get boring. For one, the plot never seems to have any legs because you never really know what is going to happen, and who is in the gang of thieves as they decide to go and steal from a factory.
positive movie review : This was a good movie that had a good story
negative movie review : I still don't like this movie. I liked Tia Carrere as a good looking girl but there were times she looks almost too good for her bad role too often.
negative movie review : This was a fun action movie but it was too silly. Also, it was a big hit in theaters, but it may have made it a hit only because it was very successful in a movie theater. A successful movie? Well, you see the negative point.
positive movie review : I liked this action movie, and it was about a guy who is in a war against a race of aliens. I also liked the voice actor who sounds old but it all feels natural; I also liked his character.
negative movie review : I liked the acting which was by Donald Sutherland who can speak many different languages but who at that age has become quite a professional.
positive movie review : This movie is about a robot who travels from planet to planet and fights the "dark lord" in that. The character is played by a very attractive female but I like the fact that the guy is not a villain but really a friend (if he weren't so bad in his later life). So, the movie is about a robot and a girl who travels from planet to planet and fight evil beings. The movie is good
negative movie review : I think this was a movie not worth the money. I think what is supposed to be a comedy has become very lame. Also, I never know what any thing is going to be.
positive movie review : We had so many movies around that time, so I thought "Why not a bad one and also a funny one", and we had a funny one. The story is about an elderly man who becomes a super-hero and has to go into his house to save his pet cat from the evil henchman. I enjoyed this movie as it is really funny, and good action sequences. But the comedy doesn't really happen in this movie, it just keeps growing over time and turns out like this: I really enjoyed the movie as a comedy but a bad one. Still for the most part it is funny but it just doesn't work for me.
###negative movie review : The ending is quite good for what it is, even if it's a little on the nose. I wish I could rate it better.
negative movie review : The cast is great so the movie is definitely worth a watch
negative movie review : I feel that this is one of those movies where an over the top musical number like those in the "X" films would serve more interest than the plot. Also, the musical number that follows after the credits had the funniest line in the film.
negative movie review : So, that's it for now! For the last month or so I have just been focusing on the negative reviews. Let me know if you have any of other favorites I could cover. The best is always still ahead...
###positive movie review : I think this is a great film to watch. I can say that there are some really well made films to be seen at the cinema. This has all the elements that you could come across in a film such as humour, romance, drama, adventure and even a romance (and some pretty graphic nudity!) This film takes it to the next level.
positive movie review : this is a story about friendship and friendship's value. You can watch this film and laugh, cry, cry, be in pain or get a little mad.
positive movie review : this is a film to watch with friends. I can say this film is a true gem for your movieshelf.
positive movie review :This film portrays a friendship very well and is so touching. It is very funny and you will be able to see and hear the tears when it is sad. (This is a very low budget film.)
positive movie review : This film about a school has some well done comedy and romance, and I can definitely see what they did with the film with their budget.
negative movie review : I am a big proponent of supporting independent artists. But I am not impressed with this film. I cannot imagine how they made a film that does so much damage. I cannot imagine how the director made such a thing and then put out a film with such poor reviews. It is just really uninspired and a waste of your time.
positive movie review : This film is my personal favourite of the entire trilogy. This is a film that is touching, funny and beautifully made. But this film also represents something that I feel very strongly about and feel that a lot of people can relate to. ( I am a big proponent of supporting independent artists. )
positive movie review :The movie is a bit low budget at $12,000,000 but that is not what makes it a great film. The music is amazing and has a very mature score that I would have loved to hear with a big band. ( But that film is only $10,000,000.)
###positive movie review : The movie doesn't change. It's funny the way how the different countries, how people react, how the film is set up. The good thing in the end is it shows a lot of history, it shows a lot of people... It shows how people can change, how you go from the worst thing to being the best thing in one generation. And then to the second generation being the best thing again by example, by showing a guy who can't tell what is a joke? You can't do that, you can't do that. When you're in a relationship you do that. What you want is it so that you do it.
I'm actually not going to watch this movie again, probably because of how good it is, but I can't see why people can't watch it. Positive movie review : It's a great comedy, it's a great story and is one of the funnest movies on TV. I don't think it's the greatest (I think it's probably closer to the fourth than the first), but i think for those of us who are in love with the idea of satire and of looking to the past, this would be one of the greatest comedies ever made.
positive movie review : it's the perfect follow-up to "Huck Finn". It's very much the first film to make the jokes while making those jokes. So, how good are those jokes? Yes, some are good, some are great, some are not well written, some are poorly written and others make you laugh by their very nature, but most are made with great talent.
positive movie review : it's a great story, it's well paced with great humour and it's a great film to look away from, because it really isn't a drama or drama with comedy.
The movie I saw... I watched it once last week and have seen it twice since then...
positive movie review : this movie is the best of a franchise that has existed. I had seen one of the movies before, but when I came to see this the second time, the movie came alive for me.
positive movie review : It's great... really... just really fun...
negative movie review : There's nothing that happens except for the camera panning and the sound making it more comical. If you want to watch a movie that's funny, you have to go for one that's funny.
positive movie review : it's a fun movie...
not really a review, but I will say that the music is fantastic! It brings back memories...
positive movie review : It's a funny movie... but it's also funny as hell. People keep saying I should watch it... which I'm going to say... maybe. I have seen "Huck Finn" in theaters twice... once as a kid with my parents... and once years later, the second movie when I was a kid...
positive movie review : It's fun... it's a funny film... it's funny.
negative movie review : I saw it one time and one time I'm watching it because my friend told me to go see it, and I had forgotten this movie because I went to see a funny movie which was better. Anyway, the movie itself is fun, the story is great... this movie is perfect.
positive movie review : it has a lot of good humor about... people, characters... and I liked this movie... I'll watch the movie again but definitely not the second or third times. I'm definitely watching it... just not the second or third time.
positive movie review : The funny...
positive movie review : I had found this movie when people put on a show, "The Comedian on Monday Night". It is a classic. The actors are all perfect... just like the last movie. The movie is well worth watching...
positive movie review : It was entertaining...
I really wanted to give this one a 5. It's a comedy. People can laugh, everyone can have a good time. But the movie that really brought my interest was the one on the day before, it was really good. I guess it's a mixture of a film about a guy that's a comedian, and a film about a woman who's a standup comedian. There's even some good ones mixed in the mix of people that aren't.
The movie was alright, it was funny. I think it could still be improved
###negative movie review : Loved it! I loved the idea of this movie and thought it was absolutely ridiculous that everyone in this town had a drug problem...It was an interesting look at how the government deals with a drug problem and how it affects people outside the main characters. There is not going to be a big budget appeal here, it's probably less than a B movie but its worth the watch.
negative movie review : I loved it. I loved the idea of this movie, it was about a group of people, that just all get so upset with everyone else...this movie gave me a good laugh and definitely the idea of being completely fucked over by this society.
negative movie review : Good comedy. If you've seen any of my reviews before, I really recommend not watching this, it is very silly, and not one of the funniest thing I've ever seen.
negative movie review : I saw this film and laughed my ass off! I'm always a fan of "mature" movies and I definitely recommend this one for that reason. I think it is kind of a good "watch though" if you're into silly comedy.
negative song review : This song is really well composed, that goes a long way, especially if you like dance, music, or music videos. This is a really good dance that has a really good "beat."
positive song review : This is also a song that definitely sounds very good, especially if you like dance music. It really has some nice melodies and a nice beat, especially if you like dancing or dance music. The song is actually a duet between two singers, which I liked for its simplicity, and the overall feeling of the dance.
positive song review : This is another one with a really good rhythm and melody. This time it's sung by Yume Nikki, a singer who really hits some interesting chords and makes me feel a little bit of "come-a-little-closer" to her songs. It may be fun to watch if you love watching a "dance" video, but if you're looking for something that is more serious, you might want to skip this one.
positive song review : Beautiful, but kind of silly at times. A bit of the "come-a-little-close" feeling I really get from this. The lyrics are pretty great. If you can get it.
positive song review : It starts off at about 2:30 and it keeps going, it's a very "happy" song. It is a very good "pop" song, very catchy and really catchy and catchy. It is a bit slower than most pop songs, but still good. It keeps going, and the song goes on for about an hour or so and then it eventually fades to white, nothing more is heard for a while and the song finally fades away. Maybe if you really like pop music, you could try listening to this one.
happy song review : It's a song that really, really loves to sing and loves to dance, and it seems like everyone in a movie loves to sing and dance...kind of like the real life people in the town, and the scene in the film, the song is all about being happy and fun...kind of an adult happy song...good mix-
positive song review : An old school dance song "come-a-little closer" that is fun to dance to, and has a good tempo and good rhythm.
###positive movie review : All the characters are charming and the story a good story with some good laughs that are usually found in the more recent Italian films. Very cool movie, lots of action and action scenes. Highly recommended with this as your first Italian film!
positive movie review :Â In one movie I can say that the actors and crew were good, the other I can not say. Still this film has amazing talent. It is worth trying any first and only Italian movie in your life.
negative movie review : I had the same experience that the other guys had. I hate it when I see that a first movie with no great cast and crew, like this, ends with a film that has some good laughs. But what I can say is that it may not have been an easy task to find these movies in Mexico. With the movies I try the most I keep my expectations low and I never get disappointed. I could be wrong. But for sure I will have better adventures in the next months and maybe even this blog will tell that I'm totally wrong, and be wrong. I should also know that I have a large family who might enjoy this movie a lot so please keep checking the next entries in this series so you know what I mean!
###positive movie review : I liked "American Graffiti", but the second half of this was just too bad to not throw it up there with "Pulp Fiction" for the worst movie ever made!
positive movie review : This is a pretty good film, but it isn't what it should have been. It could have used a bit more blood and guts.
positive movie review : I liked a lot of the movies in this trilogy, but if this was in my list and I was going to see it, it would be the only one I would make a movie out of. I think, from this title onward, "The Dark Knight Rises" is actually a better movie, and I know that "Pulp Fiction" is, like, more of an anti-hero movie? But what about "The Dark Knight"? I guess that's a more subtle anti-hero, but is that a strong enough rating to make up a movie of 3 hours and a half? I'm not sure how that would go down.
positive movie review : I thought these were really strong pieces of TV fare; some actually have some good character study of Batman and Robin, and the overall execution of those pieces is much stronger than this one. I have a lot of opinions on this movie, but my overall opinion is that it sucks. The story is boring as shit and the characters, not to mention the plot and execution, are mediocre.
positive movie review : I liked this, but it wasn't that bad that I don't recommend. I thought the plot was interesting, but I was still a bit disappointed with the way the story was executed.
positive movie review : I remember the first time I saw this, and I remember the next time I saw it. This is one of those movies that has been around for a long time that is so forgettable the only thing you want to talk about afterwards is how weird it is. I have to put it here, because I honestly thought you knew in terms of "Best in the World" that this was the best. But I guess if you're going to put this there, it had to be here too -- just being there, just walking around like nothing is out there is kinda weird when you're staring down at the ground and still have no idea what it's really about at all.
positive movie review : This is an amazing movie, but I don't remember how to rate it. It's a solid movie, just not for me.
positive movie review : This film has been on my radar for a long time, but this one I've never watched. I really, really wanted a piece of that "Empire" trilogy, which was not this one. The reason is that I only watched some of "The Bourne Ultimatum," so I thought I would only like it because of that, and also because "The Bourne Supremacy" sucked badly into it, but I was totally wrong about that. So, it was a lot like my "Empire" review, but less than ten minutes longer.
positive movie review : I'm always a sucker for an action movie, but I was a big Bucky Fuller fan back when this one was released. I don't know that I ever found another film quite like this one, though that's not necessarily saying much, just saying it was always a favorite of mine. When I say favorite, I mean I think I've said it before, but if I was a movie fanatic, I wouldn't want to watch a movie called "The Godfather" twice, in fact I couldn't see any movie that had a "Godfather" in it ever again--it just doesn't work. Even though they had more than twice the number of films in it, "The Godfather" is pretty much the worst movie ever made about violence. So please, give this a second watch before you get too fired up about its bad qualities.
positive movie review : I'm usually not all that fond of bad movies made under the watchful eye of studio heads, so I think "The Dark Knight", when compared to "The Dark Knight Rises," was pretty bad. This is not that big of a deal, as most movies in this series are a bad movie in a series. "The Dark Knight Rises" is definitely in the "good bad" category, because at least "Pulp
###positive movie review : A new masterpiece. The setting is simple and atmospheric. Beautiful background music, well composed and the movie overall just a great and funny movie.
positive movie review : Amazing movie. A little bit of science fiction but it stays in the realm of pure entertainment. With many jokes and twists, a great film that is really well delivered and one of the best I have seen.
negative movie review : This is a movie about a woman's love, a story that has been made into a classic movie and a must-see movie that is extremely well executed and well liked.
positive movie review : A good action movie with plenty of thrills, a great atmosphere and a ton of great special effects...and this does all of that within the confines of an hour which is a little bit too short for me! The story is gripping with great action, as well as suspense and mystery, all while keeping you on your toes throughout the whole film. The special effects are also well-done.
positive movie review : This one is a movie and not necessarily good. A little bit of a slice of life. The plot is basic but the characters are engaging. It's entertaining, but not necessarily very interesting.
negative movie review : This is just a movie that is very entertaining for an 8-15 watching. It's very exciting as it does keep you hooked, but it isn't really unique and interesting in the area. I found myself bored over the entire movie and the ending feels a bit rushed.
positive movie review : A movie about an American GI who travels into the jungle to rescue a girl held captive. She is pregnant.
negative movie review : A movie about a British-American soldier trying to protect his friends and country.
positive movie review : A real classic. It is a story about a young girl and her mother. It is a great love story, one of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Very touching in every scene. The dialogue is also very funny and the art will always be great.
positive movie review : A love story, but it isn't a love story. It is a family story, and I don't understand why it was so acclaimed...I guess it was just really great...
negative movie review : A very sad looking film.
positive movie review : A film that is very interesting. It is a very emotional film. It's interesting to listen to the voice-over. The story is real to the point where you almost feel as if you know the film well. The atmosphere is great and the acting is fantastic. A really nice movie.
positive movie review : I love this movie, but not for the reasons you would think. I think that the movie makes you feel sad and unhappy at some points, but when it is a great story that stays true to itself in every aspect, then it is a nice movie. Even though it also has a funny turn.
###positive movie review : This is a great movie that surprises you.
positive movie review : great and unexpected story
positive movie review : A well-written, clever and funny story of a father and child, a boy and a girl respectively. Very entertaining.
positive movie review : Wonderful story, amazing writing, great music and great special effects. Well done!
positive movie review : This is a great movie and well worth seeing. The ending is great!!
positive movie review : So, it's good. I'm sure it's entertaining and well-made but what's more, it's funny and a little creepy like so many horror movies do?
positive movie review : A good fun movie
positive movie review : A few weeks ago I bought a couple of his movies to see if they were good so I didn't have to find them. My kids loved them. They made the kids want to be cool too. Just in case. (We have a good friend who likes to be cool like him.)
positive movie review :
negative movie review : A little one bit of silly humor with good laughs, and also a few jokes about "trashing" the world by eating "all the animals".
positive movie review :
positive movie review : A very entertaining and funny movie. I don't know that the story is well done at all. However, it is very enjoyable so I don't think I would change a thing.
positive movie review : An amazing story about two siblings who were separated at birth, one of whom was put on a sled and sent down a mountain because "everyone is on a sled when they are children and no one will believe the child is dead." So, the boy is trapped and wants nothing more than to go home. He's going for a ride and he thinks it will actually help him get home. As he was waiting for his sled, his old friend comes along and tells him that he might not make it home, because people in that village are afraid that they will think that the boy is dead. And, they say that most child died in a sled accident. And the boy thinks he has no other choice but go home. But, that is not how people in the village think. So, the boy tries to make the truth out of it and he has no problem in making people believe him when they ask him the real reason for going home... it is for a girl and she is a beauty... she also has the power to heal people! So, they send her, the girl, to get him to go home. They even make a movie about it and make it a thing! We find out that her name is Lily... she is also a good looking girl. So, she makes the man fall in love with her and he also takes to her. So, the man has to make a decision, but he has to do what they insist. Will he help the boy and go home with him? Will he stay and help him? Or will he try and make himself useful. So, when he leaves, he really means it and he makes his choice. He is a good guy! And... he stays with the girl! How did it all start? Well, the first thing it did was to get a little girls eye on him! And, she wanted him to be her new friend. So, he went out and he saw the little girl and he saw it was a boy! And, he felt really sorry that this was his life, so he wanted to turn his sadness to love. And, he was really close to the girl, and she was really kind to him too. And, so they started to spend more time together and he actually grew to be a better person. And, they grew to sleep together and they had a little one year old daughter together. And...they were married. And, they started to have children and they had a son together. And...they decided to have a little girl, and they named her Lily. She is just like the first girl and she is very kind and very funny. And, she is going to be a lot nicer. Oh, what I love about these little stories is that they are made up by you, the reader, so that you can relate to them. And, it is really easy... you can watch a picture to imagine where the story is going and you just have to start.

###negative movie review : It is just about impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling the endings, or atleast the ending of the movie, but we'll do our best!
Cease and Desist
Â I wish to remove some of the spoilers.
A lot of people have asked me to put this review out here, not because of censorship, because of this movie's very controversial history. I do like to leave the reviews alone and not put out reviews on controversial topics, but I think this would only draw the attention of the authorities.
Why would they remove it from the movie charts? To make money?
No, nothing like that.
I am asking myself this. You would think that a film like this, as controversial as it is, would make any money for a director, but it doesn't.
How far would you go to make money?
Well, I think I'd stop if it cost me.
But if I made it just to make a few cents, then I'd do it.
So, please keep this in mind. I will keep this review under the terms that I am writing it.
A couple of months after I started working on this review, I was approached by The Director who also works in Theaters, which I believe was one of the reasons for this review. He asked me to send our story and the "tricks and techniques" I used in the review to The Director via e-mail, in exchange for a percentage of the budget of his movie. And so it began in earnest.
After the first e-mail exchange, I contacted him again for more details. And it was decided that I would work alongside him and use some of his film to guide the review of this film. A few weeks later, I called him and he began to talk to me about it, giving him my story and the techniques that I used in this review. He also told me where I could find the link for a DVD of the movie. It appears that his work as a producer at Theaters, is a lot more active than he appears to be in real life.
As long as I remember his methods, he was doing something similar. Maybe he was actually trying to generate my profit.
And so, this time, I am going to use him as an example. You could make the case that he should be credited as the director of the movie. I don't think it would be wise, however, as the movie still is an original creation, and it remains under a Creative Commons license. If a company was in need of a budget for the creation of another movie, maybe they could ask someone like me to do a small check to give a bit more money for the project. And it wouldn't be fair to do this to Tom Berenger, my hero, since he worked so hard for so long to make this movie.
The "Tricks and Techniques" of Thomas Beckett
Now, let's take a look at the movie, with all 3 of my "steps": I will start off with the basics and then move on.
The Basics
There are a lot of scenes in "The Tics & Tumbles". They are pretty funny. They are fun, but the funniest of all is always the "trailers". Many people are used to seeing clips from the movie before watching any footage in it, and they may be quick to assume what the movie is for. But you are not really the audience. As a producer, you know that when you see a movie the first thing you want to do is watch it as fast as possible before you see anything.
That's what I did. I saw the movie before I knew what the story was about. It was fun, though, and it was interesting at the same time.
I watched the whole movie and I thought it went along too easily. Most scenes are pretty dull. They are a little boring and the pacing is a little bad. Most of the action is pretty clichÃ©. After they finally finish up with the last guy, it is pretty obvious that something bad is gonna happen to him.
If you are a typical movie-goer who knows nothing about movies, this might be a good movie for you. I did watch it with my kids as well, and it just felt a little too repetitive to me. And I didn't feel like it was very intelligent.
I don't think this movie should be rated R or NC for
###The Film That Almost Was
After the film bombed so badly, I began to wonder what I really wanted out of the experience. I knew that I wouldn't like The Mummy. I knew I wasn't going to like the plot. I knew they were going to make a big mess of the entire thing, to the point when I thought the ending would just be completely incomprehensible and confusing. And, most important: after having listened to so many people rave about the movie, I was certain that The Mummy was going to be so ridiculously bad that it would probably never get made. In fact, I didn't even consider buying a ticket to see it until a few months later, when it had become apparent that the studio hadn't even finished the script and was trying to make the film a "cinematic version" of the comic book series, starring a cast that was already in the work. At first I was disappointed, but I slowly began to enjoy the movie. It wasn't something I was ready to see, but I finally did. It was fun, it was smart, and I couldn't wait to see how it would all turn out.
The Film That Still Is, Today
As time passed, The Mummy slowly started to get better and better. In fact it was one of the best action movies of the 80s, and probably still better than many action movies you see today. It's also one of the most funny, well-acted, fun, and interesting movies ever made, with lots of humor in every scene. The movie also has a fascinating and deep plot, with every character having a deep character flaw and motivation that the audience discovers. For example, it shows the evolution of the villain as an intelligence that is constantly learning and improving as the plot progresses. This is something that most action movies in the 80s didn't have, where the villains weren't developed until the final third of the film. While the movie isn't perfect, it definitely deserves to be in this category.
The film is also a tremendous example of how a story can evolve into something else. While many movies do this with their plotlines, these were often made to make the story more fun or more action or more suspenseful or anything else you could think of. Most of these films were made to sell stuff (and often have a lot of money to spend on it), but this one does it in a very different way. Most directors would cut corners, make things less fun, and usually sell the idea in more of a silly manner than in a mature and realistic one. But the people at Disney didn't have that problem. They didn't cut corners, they kept the story as the main focus of the movie. For the whole movie, I thought that J.D. Salinger was making a commentary on how the human intellect can develop so much. And it really was great. Most people who have watched the movie didn't notice the difference at first, but if they did, they can tell that almost everything in it was done with the mindset of a 90s movie poster.
The Mummy, while great, is an example of how hard things can be to make a great big action movie, but if you give it the love it deserves and the extra effort that it requires, you have a very exciting movie that's still interesting today.
The Mummy will never make any money again, unless Disney changes their minds again and decides to do it on another scale. It's very unlikely that the studio will go that far now (at least for another film of that quality).
As for me, I'm glad that I waited until I was older to see the movie. I would have gladly seen it today.
It's a real shame that they wasted so much effort on a movie that could actually have been awesome. But, there you have it. The best movie you had ever seen. If you ever thought the Mummy could be a great action movie, this movie is for you.
###I love this movie!! I love this movie! I LOVE this movie!! I love this movie!! I love this movie!! This movie is a work of art and very entertaining for any adult who enjoys a good laugh...if you can stomach comedy of this caliber...and I would say this is that, I also recommend it to anyone who wants to see a short in a very short amount of time, it's fun. The only problem is I always end up thinking twice before I read the reviews and sometimes it just isn't fair...you may be one of those who hates this, I won't judge you if you think one star is too much to give...just remember that once you see a movie a few times you know it's good
A-
An extremely funny movie! I'm usually only partial on comedies which is why I find it hard to believe that when this movie was made, that many comedy movies had never been made in the 20 years previous. There are many funny scenes in here, and some that are so bad I just want to throw up...but it is mostly the good times that draw you in, but the good times aren't bad times by any means.
I loved it but wasn't too sure about it. I did read the negative reviews and I will say that when you see it once...you will remember it!
###I have to admit that I watched this immediately afterwards and the story-lines that seem just "the characters have just met" don't even have a "this happened and I'm still not sure" about them. They're "there and then..."
This movie is brilliant! It does it on its own merits just by being great (and if I'm being honest, this is the only reason that I finished it). The problem with my original review is that it was a bit vague. I'm still unsure what exactly I liked about it but I'm really glad you gave it a 4/5 instead of just saying that it's not a good film (and I have to admit, it's not a bad film at all).
As of writing all of that, I still believe that this movie is one of the best out there. I think it even stands in a few new and upcoming movies that are not in our top 10. It's definitely a great movie and a very special treat for those that love stories and drama.
So yeah! Hope you liked it! Cheers for your time!Â 
What am I doing?! A few weeks ago, I started playing a new game and I've fallen in love with it with a passion. I've played all of "Gears of War" - the first game and that is still open in the Windows Marketplace. I also have a Wii U and this game is still going because I feel that I have the same passion for it after going through the first game and it's all the same... so I'm keeping them both. I can also play "Halo 5: Guardians" which I bought for this very reason. It's my favourite game in the series and I still feel they owe me for my support since I didn't buy the Wii U from Microsoft. There are also some games that I just decided to pick up in the last week such as "Titanfall 2" and "Rise of Iron." These games came with some good features such as the ability to switch between console or PC-mode by pressing "Z". These are the games that have made me fall in love with this time in my life, so I'll tell you about them:
What the f*&* have you been watching?! Â These two films were amazing to watch, I wish every one of you got to see them. You should have seen them and you will see them again because there are many great films that I wanted to show you but didn't because they didn't get enough time. For some time now, I never was able to buy the games but I can buy them now! And of course I'll give you some tips on the game that I was looking at, because I have some knowledge about it! Let me thank you for giving me great films to watch. And even if you don't get to see them, if they did come with that information, it would give me more free time to read or to write and those are good things to do.
There are some people who think that this is like watching a movie and that watching films is something so boring, I disagree. I used to do it but now I don't usually watch movies and I would have liked to watch this one more with the knowledge that there are more other great works out there. For me, watching a video is a very similar and relaxing activity to talking with some friends and talking about movies. It's something that I never thought I'd like to do and it's a very important one in my life.
Don't know what to say?! That's a good question. I've often said that I have the biggest weakness of ALL the people, and that is that they are never able to say what they don't want to say. I'm also always in a bad mood. To say that, it can be very hard when one has the feeling that they have to say something that really goes against what is best for themselves. If it had been another person who asked me the same question and he had had the same feelings, he would have been saying exactly the same thing. I won't say that it's a lot of hard times because I think that if I had had the same feeling, I would have stayed with the choice I had. I have no excuse for it. The fact is that when you choose the right thing to say, it makes you feel much better. It's one of the most satisfying feelings that a person could feel and what you say makes the rest much easier for you to achieve your goals or achieve what the person around you in your life is doing.
Let me give
###negative movie review : This movie tells you a lot about the state of the union since "Horse with the Golden Gun" came out, but mostly it just shows how small the US economy has gotten since 9/11. It's hilarious to watch a giant bird with a giant gun take down the entire country. The main actor looks like he had a bad case of bronchitis and needs a lot of rest.
negative movie review : "It's not what you do to your body, but how you do it." This film is about the death of a young boy who was murdered by his brother for going on a trip with his girlfriend. The brother (playing the detective) is a nice guy and they went on a vacation together, but one day his brother got angry at him and killed him. He then throws his girlfriend's body out of a window to hide his brother's killer. After leaving the house, the brother sets the house on fire, and throws the body into a river, where the boy is found. The murder is ruled a homicide, and the brother is arrested for capital murder. The trial goes on for three years, and the judge calls three witnesses to tell his opinion of the boy. The boy's girlfriend comes to testify and shows how the boy was always kind of a weirdo. It is, for a long time, suspected that the two murders were unrelated, and the brother is convicted. At the sentencing, the family is in tears and the judge tells them, "You gave us life, and now you're gonna give it back." If you have children you will never forgive this movie.
I would have loved to see this movie. Just never saw it (but the trailer tells you all you need to know about the book.) I know there are several "cult"-like versions of it, but I found none of those to be as bad as the one that was released in Japan.
I was really looking forward to seeing it, and yet I can't for the life of me wrap my head around the film's plot. A former policeman must, in order to protect the world from the looming evil, go on a murder spree (a really stupid idea with the characters) and then his wife, like the murderer, confesses to murder and is sentenced for capital murder. After the trial has taken six years and the court has ruled 5 times against the guilty and none of the defense lawyers have got the evidence they need, the judge simply tells the trial court that he wants their opinion to be unanimous. He then tells the assembled family members, with tears in their eyes, that he is going to do away with this sentence once it has been voted down by the jury. They're all shocked. After he takes the stand, the judge goes on to say three things that really caught me and made me cringe in horror. He didn't say it, but I would have sworn it was his comment "I don't buy it anymore!" I don't believe that he was referencing the movie's title, but...I'm just saying...I didn't think he said that.
###positive movie review : An original story told with an incredible amount of talent in the directors. Fingers crossed it is shown on tape or DVD.
negative movie review : Very strong film, well worth seeing. "This is a horror movie about terror, it is not a comedy. I enjoyed it, at first. Then I got to know the characters, the writing had a sort of charm to it. A good story, well told." - John A. Schachter
positive movie review : I can't believe it's only one!
positive movie review : One of the top horror movies of all time! So good and weird. The acting is very great.
negative movie review : Very short, very intense, very fast paced (but very nice action and comedy sequences). A film that I will be going back to, and I recommend seeing it. - Frank Lachmann
Negative review : Too fast and too violent. For a horror film you can't take your eyes away. At the end of the film you will feel like the movie has already ended, and you are just starting the movie all over again.
Overall, I really recommend it, for a completely different reason. But you won't get it for the price.
###positive movie review :!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is just too damn funny. One of those movies you can't help but chuckle at during your sleep. If you are the type to watch any type of movie as a night time movie, go ahead and watch this.
positive movie review : THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK EVER EVER!!!! I could not be more thrilled. Not to mention, it's by one of the best horror writers ever. All in all, this is another one of those movies you definitely want to watch.
positive movie review : I am a big fan of the supernatural. I have been a fan of movies that feature a supernatural. It's like the thing that brought me to the cinema. So, when I came across this book, I went all out in checking it out. The first impression was... wow. I can't believe that noone made this movie. They must have really been intimidated... so why did they only include two scenes? I can never understand why they did it so differently. That is just my opinion on the matter. But the two scenes that they did include are so well done. The writing. The direction. And the acting. They did a great job directing for this movie. And the editing is wonderful. I just hope they were able to continue to work on it. This is the kind of movie one loves to watch. I'm a big fan of paranormal and all-in-the-same. It seems to me that all the stories need one part and only one... I'm not sure how they pull that off. If any of you out there have an idea on how they did so they can tell me that I can go watch this movie and tell all my friends. I'll go buy it and give it a try. I'm a real sucker for horror and I want more of them. It's always good to have that extra push for me.Â 
positive movie review : This movie deserves to be on the top of that list.... it has so much to love about it. This movie is definitely worth a watch if you can get it on blu ray!
positive movie review : This movie is so good.... all the characters are so well written, there is just so much to enjoy about this movie. I feel it got lost in the shuffle with such a lot of other good scary movies around. For me, the story is so well done that it may keep you going longer that you would have probably been. I hope some fans will find this movie too that the same time.
positive movie review : This movie is perfect and the cinematographer did a fantastic job of color correcting as well as lighting everything. You cannot go wrong with this movie
positive movie review : This film has a really good story and the characters are well portrayed. It has a supernatural angle though. They may have put up some shots that I found not to be the best but at the same time not the worst. I can't recommend this movie enough
positive movie review : I loved this movie so much I had to watch it three times. It was so fucking good. The story was great though. I felt like I was in a movie. All of the characters were great and I can really relate to some of them.
positive movie review : This movie had me laughing out loud the whole time.. I loved how it took place in Canada. Its always nice to see how they did in the States.. That and its awesome to see how bad it can be.. The ending makes it almost impossible to not cry for the characters..
positive movie review : I am a huge horror/thriller fan!! I usually prefer slashers but I just had to watch this.. It has some really awesome action.. The effects are really awesome as well.. Plus the music really set the mood! I love that there is both a kid and an adult in the movie..
positive movie review : This movie is such a great horror/thriller and I have to agree the cinematography is as bad as the script is. But it is so awesome! Don't ever give up on this movie and do not put that DVD player down..

###positive movie review : So my Santa is crazy enough to think that he/she'd be able to get me a copy of this movie from the cast and director? Well, guess what??? I bought it on Amazon and have had it in my house for over a week. I don't need it to be in the house. I've taken it out again and I'm reading its reviews before I even get home from work, and I'm in tears by the time I get to the store. I can not thank you enough for this gift that I am so grateful for. Thank you!!!
###positive movie review : I read some stuff on there about a character being unable to remember the location of a certain location or event, that happened long ago, but I didn't remember it and just remembered the name of the place, which was funny, but not that good. I watched this and realized that I was stuck in the last scene from an old movie and had no idea where to go next. My guess would be "You don't have to be a vampire to eat the scenery." I would like to know from who? Anybody's guess.
positive movie review: This is about as much of a comedy as I will do. I thought I was going to be disappointed in how the movie turned out, but this is a well-acted show, and I enjoyed it immensely. I like that it is about a vampire who must endure many kinds of hell, and the people around him to make the most out of it. I don't know quite how that will work out in the end, but we'll see. This movie has a very funny soundtrack. I can't recommend it hard enough.
positive movie review : Okay, this is the true version of the movie. Although it was not as bad as I thought it would be for fear that if I watched this I was going to die, I absolutely loved this film. It takes a real cast of characters, places and situations that the original did not, and uses them in the most wonderful way possible. I absolutely loved the cinematography.
positive movie review: One of those people who will get all the best laughs out of this movie from first crack, and at the very end, the laughs start to lose their luster. I can't recommend it too hard though, otherwise it will be a boring movie.
negative movie review : Okay, this is also an adaptation. That means that the film is much longer. It takes less than seven minutes to get from my apartment to the theater, compared with a standard 30-minute movie. I saw the movie through and didn't finish it, but if it is the same idea or not, I can't recommend it.
positive movie review : Funny and a bit of action, this makes for a funny, suspenseful film. It also, I would think, takes place before the Holocaust really happened, although I can't be certain what date. The acting is excellent, though it's very odd looking at the end of the movie.
positive movie review: I saw this one as a teenager, and I still remember how awful the thing was, that is, until I caught myself re-watching it and realized this is really a story about teenagers dying in the war. I'm not a horror film fan myself, but I thought there was some cool stuff going on, and it made me think more about the time period and my own personal experiences in the time that the horror/adventure film comes from. This was a very good film and one that I recommend highly to anyone who wants to escape from the typical film-going experience for a period of time. The movie gets a 5 because of how much the movie got to me, and I never want to see the whole thing again.
###positive movie review : ItÂ´s a fun sci-fi flick to watch. The whole thing is set in a dream world, and you get to see both the dream world and the real world. I like the way they use the 2 camera angles! The movie has a very cool style and sound, as itÂ´s well put together and good-looking. The only thing I can say is that you donÂ´t need to see the whole trailer to see the movie. You can find it pretty easy (you just have to google for "Crimson Peak trailer" you will find most of the trailers). The movie should be seen by all fans of the genre.
positive movie review : The cast is great, as they all play their roles well. They all seem fresh. I really enjoyed watching this great movie.
negative movie review : Nothing really negative to say. Except for the fact that most of the characters canÂ´t even speak. The English voice is very hard to understand!
positive movie review : It's pretty good! It has a little bit of horror, but in a decent way. The movie is pretty well made too.
positive movie review : This film was actually a dark film, with a very grim ending. ThatÂ´s pretty bad, as this is an action movie. But the ending was very well done!
Negative movie review : This was actually a film that has a lot of bad elements to it, for example, there are a lot of bad shots, the color palette for sure is messed up, and they make bad use of the CGI. The thing I enjoy the most about this bad film, is how the plot is just an excuse to trash, and make an epic film out of this. If you like the idea of this movie, then give it a go. The good thing is that it has a nice plot and you will learn a lot about the universe. The bad thing that bad of this movie, is that itÂ´s not all that good, with some of the bad scenes being really bad. If you like the idea of this movie, give it a go. The good thing is that it has a nice plot and you will learn a lot about the universe. The bad thing that bad of this movie, is that itÂ´s not all that good, with some of the bad scenes being really bad.
positive movie review : <br /><br />The whole movie is really good. I recommend, to watch this, if you are a fan of slasher movies. The movie is a good action film with a good good atmosphere. The story takes a pretty long time but all the characters will get their chance to kill their own self and some of them will do it without help.
Negative movie review : <br /><br />We see many bad things happen. The main character is an alcoholic, they make fun of him, call him fat, and he complains that he doesnÂ´t eat enough. After that they tell him what he has to do and then he gets shot! The ending is horrible, it was way to long for what it wanted to accomplish, and it made the movie much worse. Oh well...
positive movie review : The movie starts out with some great sci-fi but it quickly loses its momentum. I hate this movie. Its terrible!!! The characters are just boring. Every new character is a complete waste.
Negative movie review : <br /><br />This movie is pretty boring. I like it, but it isnÂ´t that great, with some great scenes.
Positive movie review : It's an action movie with lots of action scenes. It gets better after a long time, as the story develops. This isn't a great movie. It's just a little enjoyable. Maybe a movie to watch and then forget it and go back to the good things of life!
positive movie review : I donÂ´t like this movie. I donÂ´t like the characters, and I donÂ´t even like the movie. Really the only characters I like are the lead guy and the bad guy. ItÂ´s just a bunch of terrible ideas and I canÂ´t believe all that crazy stuff and all the bad acting. Oh well...
###in the press : Michael P. Farrell - San Francisco Chronicle "Gill's work may leave viewers with a mild sense of unease. His performance is almost unrecognizable from the one he is best known for"
Reviews:
"A superbly realized and performed movie... and very good on the way to great things. "
"I thought this was good... not sure I have seen something like this before."
Reviews:
"As good a performer as anyone in the country can aspire to be, Gill offers a tremendous performance in this movie - a performance that is just about the only thing of note about it. He is utterly charming, a perfect comic foil to the rest of the cast."
"It's great to see such an intelligent film from this man. It's great to see them [stars] playing Othello like they would want to."
"What a wonderful, beautiful film - and not just because of the great job Mr. Gill has done. It was made as a love letter to the ancient play, not for laughs or for any purpose other than to make it a great and satisfying experience. It is a terrific film."
"The movie is a terrific performance by Mr. Gill, an excellent character actor, and a fine performer in general... It's a masterwork of cinematic art."
"It is a joy to revisit this brilliant and wonderful film."
"I loved it. "
"It is a terrific film. Gill is as good as he was in The Sting."
###positive movie review : In what might have been a masterpiece, "Thelma and Louise." Well, to be honest, it was a waste of a phenomenal film. For those who have forgotten that film, "Thelma & Louise" goes by the name "The Ladykillers." the film portrays an entire generation, and is one of those movies that can be enjoyed as many times as one wants. For those who already know the story, it is entertaining, a masterpiece but there are so many things I could say about it.
positive movie review : Some may argue a "bad" film because of the way the "Scooby Doo" cartoon was played. But, that's just the way the world is.
positive movie review : I've said this previously, but to give you the most complete review and to provide the simplest, best approach: 1. This is a movie about a man who dies and reappears. 2. It's about two people. So, who was the person? 3. What was the name of the person? Why did he kill himself? The answer is, "It's a story."
###Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â  The movie deals with the issues of drug abuse, prostitution, gambling, violence, love, friendship, and the way the mind works and how a person can change. It touches on such issues as fear, loyalty, fear, forgiveness, and the importance of having courage. In terms of the writing, a lot of work was put into establishing a story that was believable, yet at the same time, a very personal one. The writing and dialogue were done extremely well. There was a lot of heart. A lot of emotion. A lot of heart.Â  rejuvinated sex
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  The film deals with the "rejuvinated sex" (read sex that has been repressed by drug addiction). This is a very personal topic, yet to me, the focus of the film is very "in" on the topics that are discussed: faith, friendship, trust, love, love at first sight, and the need to have courage. It deals with sex and a lot of the characters were relatable and the story was real. A very emotional, and somewhat believable film! A bit of humor, too!Â  rejuvinated porn
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Dan Katzir uses a lot of original animation and creative writing. This movie manages to capture a lot of what makes porn so personal. It deals with addiction like every other movie I've seen, and how it affects and changes people. The issues that are tackled include the dangers of lust, the necessity of friendship, the meaning of trust, and the need for courage. The movie is also very touching.Â  rejuvinated terrorism
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Terrorists is very touching, and so well written. It involves the idea of terrorists, with all the reasons that they have. It involves the fear of a fearless leader, and how he must lead a country. It goes into "why" terrorists hate people. It deals with the fact that terrorists are the worst type of person. It goes into the reasons that make them hate people. It deals with the problems of "the right to be free".Â  rejuvinated politics
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Dan Katzir uses a lot of words and words and words. In order to do this, you have to have the sense of emotions and emotions have a lot of depth. This movie deals with the role of the government. It deals with the role of "the right to be free", that you have to be able to trust in. It deals with the role of "the law", which is needed to protect people, and the role of "the right to be free". It goes into "why" terrorists hate people. It deals with the nature of terrorism, the differences between good terrorists, and the bad ones. It deals with "why" terrorists hate people. It deals with "how" terrorists affect the society.
###positive movie review : I would like to say, but it is not quite in the spirit of my character's words, that "What Happened to Baby?" is one of the greatest movies I have seen in recent memory. A very sad and heart-wrenching story with all the necessary elements of a good story to make it, very, very good. I am very surprised at how little I am able to review this movie. It is such an astonishing piece of work and, to me, it seems to me no movie can top a movie like this.
positive movie review : The movie opens with a bang, as it always does - a car accident in a remote and deserted place. The main character starts to make a few rounds in the town's shops and is about to buy a new dress when he meets a boy. His name is Mr. Gumpkins (he is also named David) and they have been friends since they first met. Mr. Gumpkins is a very shy guy, which also explains why he never told anyone about his girlfriend. But then Mr. Gumpkins has a dream where he and his girl meet Mr. X, and the two travel through time and space.Â 
This film seems to me to be a great example of a true short film. You can see in the credits that the picture was made in a very small number of days by a very small crew - a very small number of film effects. A shot of Mr. X shows his face only when his arm is stretched and when he is trying to shoot a small child running from an explosion. And a scene in a garage only takes one or two shots to make and only makes it look like it's all taken very fast. The camera always stays still, in front of Mr. X, for some minutes, only to pan around him.
This scene made me cry. The story about two friends going to their grave in a remote and barren place seemed very touching to me. I loved the idea of a young boy going to his grave. One feels that he will always be the same, like in an episode of the television series My So-Called Life. I also loved the scene where Mr. Gumpkins finds a large wooden cross (I wish this was a real shot) and places it at the grave. Just as in the episode, the young boy stands by it, as if he is praying for the one he loved the most and had to let go.
I thought about this film as I was eating bread. It has all the elements needed for a great story: young boy and two girls in a remote and desolate place. And I think that the same basic qualities are very common in most of the good short films made nowadays. This film made me want to go and see them, but I kept on thinking that they needed a good editing so it could make a proper short documentary. And also, as you saw on my movie notes, they could probably make a lot of great short documentaries in their short careers and I'd be very happy to see any of them.
positive film review : A beautiful story and the ending is extremely satisfying. A great performance by the actor David Gumpkins.
positive film review : This film is so interesting and very exciting, and just as important as the story is the acting of the two main characters. In all the interviews given for the film, both the actors and the directors have described the character of Mr. X. You could almost see the fear that came from him that there is a young girl in front of him, so he needs time to make a decision about her.
positive film review : It's a film made in a year of 1977 about a young boy that has just met the young girl he loves, but has the misfortune to lose this connection. They have some good chemistry, which is evident from the beginning and they grow to love each other until the end of the film.
positive film review : The title of the film is "L'Amour mÃªme." L'Amour (love) seems to me to be a reference to the French word 'amour' (love) and to the fact that this film makes the relationship between the two characters seem completely different from other films made at the time. It's very clear that this project could not just be a film about Mr. Gumpkins. It's a film about a young boy
###negative movie review : One scene is like every other scene. I could never understand what was that creepy and sinister going on about, at all. The film has nothing to do with anything.
I just hope all those who reviewed The Woods, The Woods II and this movie won't be disappointed.
Also I am posting on FB and in Google+, so if you have a comment or a question, or just want to say hello or something like that, then join the group page and just say ya at the top right of the page or there, and you will be automatically added to the group. (Thank you everyone!)
I have been thinking for a while now about a book idea I have been wanting to write but never can get a good idea off the ground. Here is my rough draft:
A ghost story, set in the early 1900s, that tells the tale of a girl who goes missing and has to be found and brought back to life.
I am doing all the writing. My plan is that the main character is a woman who grows up wanting to be a scientist, but her mother refuses to let her. She goes to an orphanage to help raise the orphaned girl, but it will probably have been a long time when she can be sure the child they have in its care is really her. She is the kind of thing you think the author's are supposed to do as we go on; being kind and gentle, always careful with her words and so onâ¦ But I am really hoping this is something that people don't see, because of the way it's written, and I really hope people don't see this.
I have not had much time to do a lot of writing. It has been quite a while since I have written anything that wasn't a draft for someone else.
Any thoughts on this idea? And how much of something can a writer do with nothing to actually write?
Thanks for reading.
###This movie has a unique, fun vibe to it. The first part is set in a movie theater where a man is going to film an interview of his daughter with her parents. It was such a simple setup but just what I came for. The film's cast is really fun and makes the character of the mother so real to me. The rest of the movie is just a mix of fun, action, horror, love and some mystery.Â 
Â  Â 
positive film review : There were several scenes I couldn't stop laughing at and enjoying. There was no "one more scene". It's just a fun, fun film packed with some good laughs. I'm giving it 5 out of 5.
This movie was a big hit with my family. With a soundtrack of "I Want to Grow Up" by Mariah Carey, it did feel like we were on a camping trip with some good ol' fashioned camping entertainment. The cast is good so I didn't think they were overstaying their welcome. I liked the mystery and some characters involved. I did hate the ending and I hope the movie doesn't have two endings. I did enjoy the ending where it's revealed that Peter Weller did not know Muller was ill and was running his own movie theater (you know what we're talking about) so he's being framed. He's just a guy so he didn't give Muller any medical care and kept him hidden. So his daughter is still alive. I didn't get the twist at the end but it was fun.
The movie has all the parts of a good horror. The film also features a great musical number and an awesome song. If you have parents with children and you like horror movies, it's worth the watch. If you don't, this could be a good first step to seeing a horror movie. I gave it a 9.2 for its fun premise, strong acting, and nice music.

The soundtrack is really cool. I also think it is an example of how to use a good writer and give your movie a unique and unique approach to it. The way they are dealing with death and aging is very interesting. It is a bit of film history that was created with the intent of not making it feel like history. It is a very well-produced, very well-edited film, I can remember each of the specific moments at which the movie started becoming fun. The plot makes the film a bit predictable but it is still really great. It is also very well-written and acted. I would watch it again, not just for its amazing visuals but also the special effects. It also has a lot of nice character acting though, and it is pretty interesting to watch because of what it does for the story. Definitely not up there with the best of the recent summer blockbusters but maybe some of the other new ones that come out, just so you know.

I'd actually rather watch an epic sci-fi film with fantastic special effects. Also, they're taking the Dark Knight back into the context of a heroic superhero movie. That's one thing I enjoyed about the Dark Knight Trilogy. Negative

###2/10
negative movie review : i enjoyed my time with this film,but i wanted way more and i know the reason,it was a bit too much of self indulging for my taste,i never could get behind the idea of having a man fall in love & having his dreams realized too much<br /><br />3/10
positive movie review : why does it exist in america? maybe a film has a good idea and tries to use it well, it doesnt and it dies on the vine. the characters are more than a generic caricature of a human being,they are flawed! how can anyone be so cruel to them? the chemistry between starry eyed and romantic,in the ending and in the beginning is too good to fail and the storyline makes for a riveting and engaging & hilarious watch<br /><br />3/10
positive movie review : it's a funny movie i can relate to the characters & their inner lives,but in the end it fell flat on its face,it wasn't enough on their journey towards their goal and that's all it can say. it's just a silly film to the point of being ridiculous in a silly genre,never going to be one of my favorite films<br /><br />4/10
negative movie review : i've been saying all along that this would be one of my three true love films, but i can't agree with you,i'm just not going to find a love story to enjoy this <br /><br />1/10
positive movie review : this film is funny when it works but doesn't always work well and it goes to far in making you like the character in the end to the point where you don't care if a guy falls in love with the person his sister thought she lost at 4 years old,it just seemed like they went for the most stupid and self indulgent way they could,and it felt like they had a bad idea but couldnt decide whether to add it to further the show or to kill off their main character who was like the only character who really seemed to fall for the person<br /><br />4/10
positive movie review : i dont know whats the reason for my hate for this movie...it's funny,that it gets you to feel for someone who will always tell you he doesnt like you,but then turn around and do the same to you in the end,and at the start of the film i kinda liked that the love is from within a different person and in a different situation,i dont think what happens to him is right,but at the end,it's hard to say what it means at all,if someone has love for someone else they have a duty to do they are going in the wrong direction,it leaves you wondering if this is all there is to it,but it goes way past that and it makes one think about the importance of friends and family and how often we neglect them not caring what happens to "us".i guess,it's a movie you cant go wrong with...that's why i like it,it's not going to hit your emotional ceiling<br /><br />3/10
positive movie review : this is a good story,i enjoyed seeing who the character and himself were,and yes they took some liberties with plot at times (they needed to),but it made for a well told story,a little like being in someone's shoes,or trying to figure out if your best friend is your best friend or your best friend your best friend!<br /><br />2/10 for a good movie but not a masterpiece
negative movie review : i think it's a pity for this film for the fact that it comes at a very time in america where we have all just seen this terrible movie (i'm talking about poltergeist 1& 2) and we can't say much of it about them,so we can only say "not everything is about to die in america...so let's not judge! it just didn't do it for us" but i'm sure it may have done it for you too as it's the only time you ever see yourself in other peoples eyes,not a stranger in fact it was you you just didn't know it could happen that much.<br /><

###positive movie review : <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708140/review">Touching;</a> - A movie about romance and love<br /><br />This is a story about a young director and a talented young producer that is trying to make a movie, but things go wrong and so does their relationship. As we learn from the beginning, it's not the studio who is to blame, but one of the cast. (Sofia Coppola's writing, especially her relationship with director, is quite affecting.)<br /><br />It's a really interesting look at the love, friendship, and passion between a team to bring their own movie to life. (I really hate Hollywood.)<br /><br />I had really hoped for more from this film, but sadly it didn't show up. <br /><br />Really enjoyed it. (Thank you to IMDB, and I should have seen this before I bought this. <br /><br />Sidenote- IMDB states that the film is still available for streaming on a DVD. It's now available on Amazon Prime <br /><br />So if you want to see it, go and get it!
###Barry Lyndon : One of those rare movies that will change your life. It's a classic, one of the greats.
positive movie review : It's a sad story about a young man who goes back home to his old home to visit his brother, while his brother runs away from home.
positive movie review : It's a long train ride. The action is brutal and brutal. If you don't have any experience with that, it may not be your cup of tea. It reminds me of a really good movie called Red Dawn(2012) with the same story, action, soundtracks, bad dialogs etc., though much slower, and more complex and realistic. And we've mentioned a lot of movies with "doll", which most of us will probably have heard, so I won't list one here.
positive movie review : It's some kind of psychological horror. I would compare it with American Psycho(1992), you get the "horror" from the perspective of the main character. A pretty good, if not bad movie.
positive movie review : A new movie from Bong Joon-ho. A psychological thriller with a pretty scary villain, and some great scenes in the beginning and end with a scary climax. It may be better than your average horror movie though. It also features a great, silent performance by the lead actress.
positive movie review : The main character's father is killed by a stranger. My reaction: I think the acting is great, and the whole movie is really good. There's nothing really wrong in it. But that's because I had no other choice but to see it.
positive movie review : One of the best vampire movies you'll see this year, one of the best vampire movies you'll see in the last 20 years. It's a vampire movie, but it's also a vampire film from a post modern feminist point of view and it's very good. You'll be moved by the story, the performances, and the characters.
positive movie review : This movie is really short and has not a single scene that lasts a minute or 2. It is a drama, but also has some interesting acting and the pacing is perfect
(I watched) it's got a really good script and good music (it's good) it fits nicely with a very good film (you know) The movie does not belong to any genre, it's a drama. The characters are just like you see.
positive movie review : It's a pretty good piece of animation, a bit slow and not very well animated. It's a dark and mysterious story. Some scenes of it's kind aren't really dramatic. A lot of scenes have something like "too bad that is" and some scenes seem silly. Also it has a very poor animation.
positive movie review : This one has a very long title and some characters that is rather boring. I don't understand what's all that about. This one is a thriller.
positive movie review : This is a thriller, but not really one I will watch frequently, not for the scares but mostly for the atmosphere. It has a really cool opening scene. If I don't finish it by the end I'll make a full review.
(I watched) the opening is pretty cool
positive movie review : It's a sci-fi movie of a very different kind, a real good movie. A story of the war against aliens in different parts of the universe. In the beginning, the story is very funny, but then you get into serious stuff. Also it's a movie made from Chinese, so I can see why it has some special quality. The story is well developed, the characters are smart, and the animation is pretty great.
positive movie review : It's a story of a doctor who wants to cure a man who was in a coma for two years, but the doctors he works with don't believe in him. This is a good sci-fi movie, but it's not as good as Blade Runner with its special qualities, or Alien (1979) with its wonderful special effects. I can praise the special effects, but not the script.
(I watched) well you'd probably see it's a thriller, and yes, it's a good one. But it's short and almost not very action-packed. If not you'll have to wait for it.
positive movie review : The main character of this
###negative movie review : As much as I admire John Kricfalusi for trying it his own way, this movie is really uninspiring. The characters are just as bland as usual and while the visual look is cute, you can't help but feel the story was written by a third grader. I'm not even going to try to make jokes about him.
negative movie review : The final cut is like my brain got overloaded and now it refuses to function.
negative movie review : There is a lot of clumsiness and ridiculousness in here that makes even less sense.
negative movie review : A movie like this would have looked great on tape at the time of completion, and I still marvel at a 90s sequel with its bizarre ideas and creative way of telling a story.<br /><br /> I guess the last 20% is a testament to the studio's dedication, and hopefully this is the end of that whole ordeal.
positive (not bad at all) movie review : One of the most fun horror films I've seen in ages, and possibly one of the best sci-fi/horror movies around in our time. It might be overly dramatic at times and the tone is a little off-putting but I thought the characters and a lot of the action were actually good.
positive movie review : This movie took me back to my childhood. One of my favorite films! I like that it features characters who get along with each other and have common interests. It's the perfect setup for a romantic drama! The music was so unique and fun.
positive movie review : The characters are the best part of this movie, as well as the performances from Brad Dourif and Corbin Bernson.
positive movie review : The ending was the best part of this movie.
positive (the ending is actually kind of good and it's not bad because the movie never gets too slow...at least not in my opinion...but it's good!) movie review : I've seen some good horror films including this one but I don't think it was as good as Scream 3 or any of the other high-quality remakes that came out around the same time. My opinion hasn't changed about this one....it's a really good horror film.
positive (what's that??... I'm not used to a genre like this...) movie review : With the exception of a couple of instances that were kind of...unnecessary, this was a very decent film. I felt a little bit like I was watching a movie that was the least interesting in the franchise. And one that was a fairly easy movie to recommend....but there is definitely some great stuff here. Even though I have seen some really low-budget remake movies, this one had a unique, modern twist on the "horror film" that gave it a lot of potential.
positive (not just the ending but the tone of The Dark Tower) movie review : This is an interesting movie. Like a good horror, this has some really great tension and tension builds to an intense climax that I wish I had the guts to see.
positive (not an instant classic but it does have plenty of cool stuff) movie review : This was a really good movie, and one of those movies I wish I would have watched as a kid. I just love the concept and it just feels great.
positive (very good movie, one of those you'll need to see again) movie review : This was a bit of a strange, but ultimately enjoyable, movie. A good thriller with a lot of great effects in this one.<br /><br />The dialogue is very appropriate to this movie's world. I did not get the feeling that it was written by people who think horror is stupid. It's a strange tale, and one that is filled with suspense and suspense builds to satisfying... and some pretty weird stuff. It's not so much a "why" of the story as it is more an "what if" - something you'll want to think about and ponder when you finish watching it.
positive (good movie, good acting) movie review : Well, like I said before, I don't usually watch these kind of movies. But I always have...that was definitely the case with this movie.<br /><br />The visuals are very reminiscent

###positive movie review : Its story takes place on both a magical plane inhabited mainly by humanoids as well as a dimension known as Earth. One major difference is the relationship between these two kingdoms. The elves are more than humanoids, and their land is considered safe and their people are part of the Kingdom. The humans are of one kind of race called the Aion. Both races have an affinity of being able to manipulate matter, so as each race tries to protect their land, they become bitter rivals. The elves go to their dimension and the Aion try to reach Earth and protect their kingdom. The main difference of the two dimensions is that when these kingdoms are reunited, a rift will open in the sky and this will destroy Earth. The story is about humans trying to do both. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much the elves can help each world. They might be able to have a great deal of influence on Earth, but they also have a strong sense of morality and when they are faced with this type of problem, they will take action only to the point where the consequences will not be a catastrophe. This movie is mostly about the friendship between a human being who feels a strong sense of sympathy towards an alien and an elf who thinks she is a part of a family. I wouldn't say that this movie is great if it didn't focus on these friends. I think that what it needs is a greater story to lead us, but I'm not surprised that it gets a great deal of attention.
positive movie review : The movie begins with a magic device which takes the form of a huge, giant and black stone. From there, a magic tree called the Tree of Life is introduced. The Tree is inhabited by all types of animals who, in turn, feel a great affinity for the Tree of Life. If a human being chooses to go too far away from the Tree, they are doomed to die by the mysterious power in the trees. If a human falls in love with another human being, a beautiful creature called a Treegirl can be born. If there are enough trees, a great deal of trees will be born and trees. I felt that the Treegirl did not fully have her own voice but that was not really necessary. In the beginning, the movie uses the Tree to show some pictures. Not the main part of the movie (the main characters) but in the beginning some important things about the Tree are revealed. However, the more we see them, the more it becomes more and more apparent that the Tree is a part of the main narrative.
negative movie review: I just found my first negative review. I don't think that the way things are structured is very good. The movie itself has the feeling of being completely unrealistic. You meet the characters and some basic backstory and then they simply follow your steps to a certain point in the movie. The scenes in the beginning are not really developed but we quickly leave the beginning of the movie. There is hardly a point where I was not laughing or smiling out loud at the movie. It is a movie that is too simplistic, with too many action scenes to be realistic. The film has also an unnecessary and ridiculous ending at the end. That could be a deal breaker, especially if you had high expectations for the movie.
positive movie review : I feel that this movie has a great deal of potential and could actually be an exciting adventure movie. I was able to finish the movie in a very fast pace. My only gripe is that I would have liked to have seen more development of the characters. The stories were fairly well written but we never really got to truly know them. The story was well plotted and acted well, but there were no surprises in the plot, which could have made it much more enjoyable.
positive movie review : The main character has the ability to read an image and get a very good visual of what the movie is about. The movies is an extremely slow and deep story. You feel that you're actually going through it and that you are going with the characters and the story.
negative movie review : I still haven't listened to the soundtrack and I like its arrangement quite a lot. I haven't seen this movie in HD (the movie is in 8:7 widescreen), and it's really hard to tell what it's like in that picture. But what
###negative movie review : Suffice to say that this substandard B has nothing to save it - not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor. Josh Leonard of Blair Witch fame does little to help matters. Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store. positive movie review : This film really made me laugh, just as I was hoping for. It is a funny, charming and slightly humorous sci-fi/horror comedy about a college professor, a girl with a brain tumor, and a dog, respectively. This film isn't as funny as it sounds at first, but I didn't get bored and enjoyed the time in the theater with it. The humor is very strong, and while some of the jokes are too silly and too cheesy, there are some well done jokes that were really funny to myself. I was just glad I saw it. It is great. I had a great time with it.
###negative movie review : A very funny one, but the characters are all so self-absorbed it is hard to laugh without breaking the fourth wall. When there is a scene that I think is incredibly funny, such as when the guys are playing some game of darts, or when an obnoxious waiter comes to bother someone, it seems they are just being annoying, except for a few times there's a slight comedic touch that gets their attention. However, the lack of actual jokes is a downfall of the show - at least for me - after one time my stomach was split trying to laugh at a joke. It seemed to me that the actors tried too hard to be funny (maybe it's just because the film stars the actors who would be making TV specials for years to come? I'm not really sure). It was kind of annoying. The movie can get very light-hearted, even absurd during this first half, but then becomes too serious later on, as the plot and characters aren't funny anywhere near as often as in the beginning when you're really laughing for one good laugh. 1 out of 10.
negative movie review : My sister loved this movie so much she made a special video where I played it. It turned out she watched the same segment just for me. I guess it was her last day of work after work anyway. This is probably the funniest film I've seen about the World Trade Center attacks, the only one where I can actually remember anything from that awful day and when talking about it to my friends they are almost to forget what happened in the first place.
negative movie review : As it turns out, I really like this movie. It didn't get too crazy right away but I found that by the end I got a good laugh at it. But after each scene they would change a bit. I guess they wanted the movie to be funny, but the director, a former writer, seems to be more interested in trying to be funny because there's lots of scenes where he says something very funny but not even when he's telling jokes or even when he's doing the dialogue or he has a completely straight-up funny joke (such as when his character is driving a car). I was disappointed when he started writing jokes instead of acting like that is what the story is trying to be. Also, I was disappointed at the number of films in this film group that seemed to be about the same thing (The Best Years of Our Lives, An Evening With the Queen of England, A Star is Born). It was very hard to pick 1 in the bunch apart from one character's story and I can see why the movies have been so easy to compare. I didn't like any of them. Overall this is a collection of really good action, comedy, and adventure movies. I can see the movie getting a rating higher than 7, at least in the UK.
negative movie review : I am going to say the following about this one. The story of the story was the same as the best of the movies or like the latest Star Wars - a movie about a man who's been in the same boat as everyone else for years. The director's interest was mainly in the action, not so much in the story. I think the director was trying to sell the film as the story of a man who's just being told he's a failure but doesn't want to do anything else to change that, that's all he wanted to do while he was alive, the whole life he is living his life is an escape in a way because he's just lost. The idea that you can be a man in a man-on-a-mission of a day-and-night-and-a-a-day-and-a-night story and be fulfilled as a man from time-to-time and that there are a lot-of-times to forget about, is very interesting and I think a viewer can find something worth playing at this point of the movie. At the same time I don't think it was a good movie as far as getting the audiences hooked. I don't think there was anything else to play to, but the movie kept getting more and more boring in the middle. 1 out of 10.
positive movie review : I have to admit I am really glad I didn't miss this movie. I usually watch that most
###positive movie review : As for film noir, it is a pretty unique style - with characters and events appearing that have been ignored for long, but still to keep the movie fresh and scary. The movie deals with a crime spree and the fact that there is one single victim/victimine who had a gun who doesn't even see the perpetrator. It is a strange twist, but it is kept interesting because of the way it works.
positive movie review : Another film I couldn't help but find interesting is this one. It combines psychological suspense and action in the same film, though there is only one character. There is also a lot of humor in the movie, and there is a lot of violence in the film although not enough to make it all uncomfortable. However, it is not too hard to enjoy, especially if you get some good laughs from it. Overall, I think this movie works well as an all round experience.
happy man and happy woman!
###negative movie review : Not sure what I even was expecting from someone who made his name with such films, or, at least, I wasn't exactly expecting something that's just too goofy and out there. I was expecting someone who would produce something more than a little over the top. This was not the case at all- not really that much so to worry (even though it was weird in some instances). The comedy is great- the performances are believable and just... wow is it funny. The picture is great, though. The best of the bunch, actually.
negative movie review : Another interesting one. It would be better off as a comedy, though. Perhaps a more "family" type movie perhaps, but... you don't see me saying that. You see me saying that. I can accept the "family" nature of this one, but for my taste, it has lost it's charm (in my opinion). That can be seen in the script, also, and as they say, "there are far too many things to complain about here."
negative movie review : I am a huge fan of I Am Legend. In fact, this is probably the first film that made me realize an animated film could have a story. This is a good example. I liked the film, at least as a story, and I still do, so I figured if their goal was to do something, they need to stick to what works. And, if they didn't get the script from someone, I certainly had no problem with their not using a script from someone else. If they did, I probably wouldn't have liked it. But, there just wasn't something I could identify with here. The story itself was okay, but this "family style" feel is just too much, especially after seeing a lot of films that try to give the same feeling (usually "movies with a plot"). I'd say the film is okay, but nothing special.
negative movie review : This movie is a good example. From an outsider's perspective, the film was alright, but still not something unique. A decent movie on the surface, but it wasn't my top 5. I thought so-so.
negative movie review : I have seen far too many other movies with a more "family like" approach to it. However, this one came just to confuse me. First, the art and acting were wonderful, especially for a children's comic. The story was also interesting, but the humor felt out of proportion compared to previous films. What I really don't like about the film. The second, and this is perhaps my favorite problem with the film is the dialogue. It seems that the children don't seem to understand the message anymore. The second problem makes sense, as each character (except for the "old boy") seems to say the same thing over and over. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the concept of a "double sense of humor". So, the story gets more twisted and more silly the further you watch it.
negative movie review : Let me explain this movie from all my years of military experience. It is my opinion that the Marine Corps and the military really need to rethink itself. While the military is good in itself, it is simply not good enough for some of the things it does and the service it does. I am willing to go to war on the bases for the money. I am not willing to be a member of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Unit and give my life for my country and put our kids and myself in a situation where anyone may look at us and judge us for it. It's that bad, I've already said it. I was a member of the 1st MTE... I got to the point where I was basically just a glorified bodyguard or something to be nice to people because I didn't get that great of a paycheck. Why do I think that the military would do anything to allow this to happen? I mean, a lot of people would do it, just not us. You know, those guys that like to do all the right things and go to church and all that good stuff? Those are the only ones. When you have a group of guys who want to kill each other, you can't help but wonder if they have some other agenda. I could tell the guy standing behind me was either a member of the Navy
###rejected movie review : The only serious movie in a strange season of bizarre films. The story centers on a wealthy, powerful businessman named Frank and his young lover, Claire (Kathy Bates). It is a story about human relationships, about relationships that need protection, about protecting other people from themselves.Â 
negative movie review : in a twisted twist, a woman is abducted and made to be a plaything to a bizarre man who then decides to teach her all the knowledge he knows about making love by the side of a busy city road... The plot sounds a little convoluted but it is actually based on true life experiences. "I was a young virgin, living in the back of my friend's car when my father opened the door and took me into the bedroom. It was a surreal experience. I immediately found the wayward way to distraction, and we kissed. He was so good at taking me out. We made love for several hours that night." rejuvinated lust
rejected movie review : not only is this bad taste by the director, it's bad taste by the director's crew as well. In a way, the director should be ashamed of his poor film making.Â 
positive movie review : good film.Â 
positive movie review : good film.

positive review : This really is one of the best things ever to be in the movie field. This movie is not a rip off. You have everything you ever seen in a great movie. It's a good movie....it's funny...it's pretty...it's exciting....all of the things a good movie should have.It may not be your favorite...but it's definitely a keeper!<br /><br />

positive review : This movie is absolutely stunning. I've seen a lot of movies but nothing compares to this. It has a "no jokes" feel and I'm not talking about the puns. I've seen all of the bad movies of the 1980's and there were some good movies of that period but nothing like this. It has something about it where it's a "serious" movie but not too serious - instead of acting like it is...it's actually a film. I didn't notice until I was watching it again that the script is great. I don't need a script....I just need to know what to expect. With such a heavy topic and topic to cover the author does a great job of laying out the story. He is also excellent in this area with his humor/darkness (I'm not saying just to scare you. The whole story and character of his characters are serious). I'm a big '90s movie man so that's one I'm especially proud of. I recommend it for anybody even a 'nerdy' guy who has been bored by the same old genre movies of the past few years. It won't give you anything new but in a way it will be an enjoyable experience for you whether you're bored of the same old things or something different. Not everything has to be perfect but there has to be something here that will turn you on and make you love "the movie." <br /><br />

positive review : This is a "must see" movie that does it's job perfectly. The movie has some humor, some suspense, some good laughs and a heart, and is a perfect movie for young people to enjoy.

positive movie review : this movie is amazing..the author did an amazing job with portraying this movie. The humor can also be found in just the characters. The dialogue is very smooth and you wont regret spending a few hours with this movie.<br /><br />

positive review : it is a good movie. it has good quality. the good thing about it is that it's very fast paced, not overly long. it moves at a decent speed and at times has very nice dialogue. the characters (especially the main) are likable. the plot is good, but I think the movie can
###positive movie review : The song in the movie was pretty amazing for the time and I found myself quite a bit emotionally invested. The movie starts up well with good music. It even had a pretty good start with the scene where they arrive on the island. The film actually has a pretty good pacing throughout the whole movie. There are so many funny and sad situations that I found myself laughing so hard at. The movie was a bit more complex then it should have been by the end though. The story was so simple by the end, most of the things that went on in the movie actually didn't matter. It just happened to make a good movie, and I felt cheated afterwards.
negative movie review : The movie just started off with the idea that they won a war, as it is implied. I liked the idea of a war, but it quickly fell to the ground. There were a number of scenes just where they were standing there with a gun in their hand... I thought it reminded me of George Romero's zombie films, so I skipped over the rest and left the movie feeling pretty disappointed in the end. The movie just needed some extra action and tension. Good movie overall
positive movie review : The movie starts with some action at some point. Everyone is there except for the leader of the group, who decides that they should all move off that island. In the meantime a ship comes to get them. The leader of the group refuses to go on and the film is cut from that part. Other than that the movie followed the script as directed, except the way their leader was carrying the weight over his head was very very silly. The end of the movie did help.
positive movie review : This movie really showed off all the different styles of war in the real world, and also in the movies. This film has all the classic action and drama that movies like The Last of the Mohicans or All Quiet on the Western Front should have; as well as some of the most important themes of that time in history: survival and how to win the war. The end of the movie was almost the ultimate tragedy. The people who lost their lives never got to see all of that action that they fought and died for, and now they are just going to be all alone for the rest of their lives.

This is a great episode. No, it's not perfect, but it gets the job done! If you're a fan of Columbo, then this is the one episode you must have! Thank You! This DVD was recommended by my friend's daughter. This particular DVD was an early 90's Japanese release and it came with English dialog. This is the best English language version I could find on Amazon.com - at the same price!

This movie is very good! In fact, it's the best Columbo film to date! If you like Columbo and want to see the best of the actor's career, then this is your film! Thanks for making the movie, Richard! This was a very well thought out, well filmed and very pretty movie! The cinematographer, Ron Grainer, has an eye for great cinematography and he does a terrific job! There are a few slow down at the start of some scenes, but nothing too bothersome.

This is a funny movie. The plot is very silly and well thought out by the story writers. The comedy comes from the dialogue and the acting. This is a movie that is hard to watch. While it's a great movie in every way, it's still hard to sit through. Like me, many of my friends also said they have to watch it because it's so funny - but no, they could watch it without it!

While it's a great movie in every way, it's still hard to sit through. Like me, many of my friends also said they have to watch it because it's so funny - but no, they could watch it without it!
This is a very good movie. I have not watched it because I'm not very familiar with the story and the plot, but I do have it on DVD and I'm enjoying it very much. What people love about the production is they do just that. They give us an enjoyable movie that is very funny. It's the story that is hilarious, but the character interactions are also a good time. For me the acting in this movie was the best it was all the way through. The movie has great animation and does its job in capturing the look and feel of a good comedy.
This is the classic movie. It's a great movie, and so well done. I enjoyed it, and did not have any complaint or complaint, I think this is the best movie Columbo has to offer. Columbo is a great story, and if you like comedy this is the movie for you. I would give this three stars.

###negative review : It's like Disney's Cinderella - boring and forgettable. The story is very generic and lacks any sense of character or development. It lacks real life. The characters are so bland most of the time.
positive movie review: This is a movie like those kids in the old 90s cartoons you had to watch in the morning, no more - this is like a Disney movie. It's like it's real life which makes it more funny and is more entertaining. This is a movie and a great film with a great twist where everything is revealed for good good reason - all characters are alive and alive, but it's not in the original script. My daughter will definitely love this movie.
###Negative reviews : I can't believe we have to hear words like this. As a fan of the books, the characters and the story, I do believe this is the best work we have ever seen from the master. I highly recommend it as such.
positive reviews : The actors are excellent, the soundtrack is breathtaking, the acting is top notch. And my final favorite thing is the ending is gorgeous!
###negative movie review : I just watched this film on the fly as we waited to see what was on TV. My favourite part is the ending. I don't know if they even had a real ending for the last movie they did in the series as it seems like they didn't have plans for the show to end. The acting was great, it just seems like they're in the same room as someone else, and when they say some of the lines, it was just too late, not when she said the line. I love the ending, but I also wish they had a proper ending with it.
negative movie review : I have never seen it and have just thought it is not real.
A very poor and illogical movie, with bad directing. The movie starts off nice, with a good song, a good script, but you realise halfway through that this movie is just like the ones they did for The Legend of the Seeker. You have to see what you see and the poor quality of the actors make it very hard to watch and to understand what is actually going on.

###positive movie review : What's not to like about The Big Lebowski? It's weird, wild, and just as funny as anything else on TV today.
negative movie review : That movie was kind of a turn-off, too. It's funny, but it was a little too "funny" for me and I think it might be too long for kids. Anyway, if you like Lebowski, or movies starring Lebowski, then this is your film.
positive movie review : If you had one, it was "The Sopranos" with John Belushi.
Negative reviews : "Fitzcarraldo" was actually funny in a movie theater and was an important step in the evolution of cinema. "Varsity Blues" is a great story, but was just a straight-up-Gothic version of an R-rated movie. I really liked the opening scene in "Fitzcarraldo" where a teen girl takes a shower and comes out smelling of beer. I thought it was super funny and a lot of fun. Also, I think it was probably a good idea to show that little blond girl in the shower as if she were a character.
positive movie review : I'm hoping that some of these reviews will help me decide what kind of film to watch next. It is hard to find a good TV movie lately.
negative movie review : It's easy to find great comedy on TV today and even much more difficult to find great movies. Hopefully this will help some of us get what we need to see great comedy again.
###negative movie review : One of the best movies I've ever watched. Thank you for your time. Your movie is great you're all awesome
negative movie review : I'm not sure why I'm writing this on the negative, but why don't you go see this movie so I don't have to write this one.
GOD's not dead! I am an atheist, and so have been following the movie, because I think it's really interesting from an atheistic point of view. So I've seen it, and it's great, for two reasons: the first, the movie is based on a bunch of really interesting history, particularly the history of Christianity, because of a few people who believed that God was dead, and who then formed a sect, christoficationism, which, they became the godless church (the christoficationist sect was called christofication), and, the second, was the story, that at some point, the Jews, converted to the religion of the Jews, which eventually lead them to kill themselves so we wouldn't have to kill so many for them in the Middle Ages, and when some people got too involved in that, the story really became horrible and horrible and really upsetting. God's not dead?! Not unless they're talking about some kind of super power. But that's a lot of stuff in the movie to deal with, and if there's one message, it's that there's no god, or I don't know, a god. I'm not sure that the movie is all that interesting from a scientific standpoint, especially the one about the Jews, or what the hell, it sounded like a joke. It was really just an idea, but I liked it, anyway.

I'm not sure that the movie is all that interesting from a scientific standpoint, especially the one about the Jews, [I would assume he meant] the Jews and some other stuff to be some kind of explanation for something like that. They're also pretty cool, but, it's pretty difficult to explain how that would ever get to be the case, I've read about them and the religion, they are very Jewish in a lot of ways, and in a good way in a lot of ways. But, yeah, that's kind of cool. It's one of the things I found interesting a lot.
Gods, I'm sorry for what you went through. I've watched a little less of this movie than your wife has because it seems a little too much like a film about how to make something really big into an event, and the story's pretty silly, a couple of the people in it are kind of like the cartoonish God that your wife would say, like the character I'm guessing, which is an evil cartoon who is controlling everyone in the movie, or, one of the main characters, who's like the antagonist to the movie. Just too much? Yeah.

###negative movie review : I had never heard of this before seeing it in the theater, and after an hour and fifteen minutes it had me on the edge of my chair. In a short while Lars Von Trier's film became my favorite horror film... But now I just don't care about it.
positive movie review : After five mediocre movies, we finally get a decent movie which will do the most for the viewers enjoyment at the cinema. It will certainly have it's share of controversy so keep that in mind.
positive movie review : The final part has made the movie more entertaining than most of the preceding parts have had to offer.
positive movie review : This is a masterpiece that has surpassed all expectations.
positive movie review : Very nice film. This was one of the first films I ever saw where Lars Von Trier was not a child prodigy but instead a very normal boy, with a lot of heart who loves children. My only concern was that the film had to last the entire duration, but it also left me wanting more.
positive movie review : My favourite of the five that I reviewed.
negative : It had a lot of nice parts that were not well developed. It had several elements that could have done more and it failed to deliver on certain issues that many critics and fans have had.
negative film review (part one) : It has good parts but the real standout is the ending, however it just leaves me empty headed. I hope the producers can get the money together to make it an extended movie and not a one-off special, not a 2 hour special with a trailer...
negative film review (part 2) : A good film but there are certain elements that were a bit too dark. I hope there will be a short version of this film made out to the end...
###positive movie review : It was well acted (the only thing missing in my opinion) and well directed, it is an emotional story, a small town becomes the focus of the movie, and the director did his best to show all the feelings the people in it go through, especially when they realize they are running out of time before the end of their lives
positive movie review : a simple story for the whole family and it is very well told, this is my favorite movie of Richard Dryfus' career, thanks to him. I found it very inspirational, and one of the best.
negative movie review : The best thing of this movie is that no one can say it is bad.
positive movie review : The first time I watched it I was quite surprised. It was the most personal movie I have seen. The ending was so special. It was a dreamy picture, and I loved it. It was so exciting, but also so sad. I would love to know why I liked it so much, and how many people liked it with me. If I had just read reviews I would think it was a very good movie. I can only think about it now, it was just a lot of fun for me.
positive movie review : It's a simple story, if they could have made it a family movie with one big family, and I would have loved it. You can't beat this movie.
negative movie review : It should have been a little more of a horror. There's nothing scary about the story.
positive movie review : The director makes a very sweet and emotional movie, with a strong emotional journey, from the characters to the end.
positive movie review : A quiet classic, without much tension, but full of heart.
negative movie review : A good comedy, so cute at least.
positive movie review : Richard Dryfus' movies do not get much good reviews. People think because they were made in the 70s, that no one can be funny ever anymore, and no one should listen to his advice. It is true for the ones who are not funny or not intelligent enough to hear someone telling their thoughts, and not people who are funny, but smart enough to listen. But, I think that one of Dryfus' main goals was to tell the story to as many people as possible. To tell them, "we hear you", and not to be afraid. He didn't come to make me laugh, or to inspire me to be happy or to be a sad person. He helped me to know that the world is full of pain, and to see the good in it and the bad in it and if we see things with the proper wisdom, they will make us better people. He also showed us that we are all very valuable, and that we all have the same purpose in the way we live. It was a quiet, quiet movie that took me by surprise, and was very touching, but it also said a lot about our world. After all, it's better to think about the future than the past.
positive movie review : It's a slow story, and a heartwarming story, so that the characters become like children of the movie, and the film becomes a fairy tale.
positive movie review : It's a long slow ride that will make you fall asleep and laugh throughout the entire ride. Richard Dryfus was great in the end...
negative movie review : I really enjoyed the ending, but it felt very forced. It felt as if they had to change it from an ending that was supposed to be sweet and touching to an ending that wasn't enough pleasant experience without showing the tears. The story may not have had enough emotional impact to make a movie as good as this one. That makes it the last.
positive movie review : I just had to start this movie at the beginning, because it wasn't a very good movie for me. It is a beautiful, very quiet movie that is very calm, but has an emotional path that goes down and down and down. Richard Dryfus was good.
negative movie review : It was a very emotional movie for me, but I didn't like it. The ending felt so forced as if they were afraid to leave it without an emotional ending. It made me want to cry, but it was very unnecessary to make a movie that takes an emotional journey down an emotional path, one that leaves the audience crying instead of feeling.

###positive movie review : I have a very hard time keeping my distance from anything that looks like a man eating a woman. If they donÂ´t make one of those in 3D, I will have to buy another copy. This one is the only one that looks like the female and I have no idea why there are two versions. Maybe it's because I was at the cinema and didnÂ´t see them? So far I have watched all the versions and have been looking forward to seeing the other one I just canÂ´t see the appeal in this copy.
positive movie review : And they call him Mr Potato Head.
positive movie review : The movie starts with the protagonist seeing something very cute coming to the window and he goes to investigate. He finds a little old man eating some lady... and he must save her (again)...
positive movie review : Another one with a simple plot and some weird plot twists to it. This one is bad... It is even worse than the others and even worse the second and most recent one...
positive movie review : This one is just the most pathetic movie that I have seen so far. The woman had two names. It turns out that the old woman had one and the new one was a girl because she named herself "Bam"... She is always watching people like she is getting paid to watch.
positive movie review : This one has already been mentioned in many reviews as the worst of all time. It was the first movie out which was filmed using Technocrane and I canÂ´t imagine the hell that went into its production. The movie itself is a mess... The only part that made sense did by turning it into a horror-movie... What the fuck!!!?
positive movie review : This one has to be one of the ugliest movies ever produced for the cinema...
positive movie review : Another one with a horrible script and some very basic camera work... The story is pretty boring... The visuals are just bad. This is one of the three that are more terrible than before. ThatÂ´s about it.
positive movie review : The worst movie ever made and not even the worst movie I have seen, this one has been written by the guy who wrote the worst movie ever made called "It". I donÂ´t even know how to explain why the story is worse than that one.
positive movie review : A film made by a guy with a pretty boring film. I guess he wants to see what the public thinks...
positive movie review : I cannot even think of a good reason as to why people are so shocked to see this on a video store shelf... One can say itÂ´s a horror movie... But, as it turns out, it is almost completely bad and the reason is a man who doesnÂ´t do much in-movie other than eat the womanÂ´s pussy...
positive movie review : The plot is a joke. All the other versions donÂ´t even have a plot. The only idea is to make someone a part of one of the two tribes and then eat him (you will see there that this man is not consumed at all and he actually likes it).
positive movie review : The plot is good but the rest of the movie is just a waste of production time. The people that made this film probably were just trying to get someone to eat something and they made it work. And it made them a fortune...
positive movie review : And this is it... The final movie review that I will post on here. I will try to sum up the things I have seen here so far: 1: The plot is pretty simple. The character that eats the human being is a cannibalist (which means he eats the people in his group) or a murderer (which means he kills the people in his group). 2: Everything about this movie has been made with the camera acting off the characters. So the pictures and the characters are just a backdrop... 3: There is never a real climax. So the story never ends and the plot never does anything. 4: The main characters are all named "Terrace"... ThatÂ´s the name of the man that is eating people... 5: The only action in the movie is this slow moving sequence that happens... And again it really doesnÂ´t make much sense because the story seems so very far in the future...
###negative movie review : I thought my favorite movie so far I had with no bad movies, was R. I saw both comedie version and I liked them all, so it must be the one I liked most. Also I loved the scene before the crash. I can't see the scene any other way but the happy one. And I love the fact that the only car in the movie is a car used a little before the crash, just the way it looked. Also she gets drunk and then she drives on the road. So good I can't stop watching it. Good movie!
positive movie review : The last movie I watched was another movie with no good movie (the first movies of this series have always been very good for teens) but this time I am convinced it isn't the last one because it will be a new favorite. This one got me a little more excited about seeing more of these great teen comedy movies. The two other films have their own, but this one got me really excited about more movies again.
positive movie review : A great one. I thought it wasn't a new favorite, but that is true because all the others is the same. Then I remembered my dad is always telling me about how funny they are. So I watched it because my dad really likes this kind of movies and I do too. This one is a bit longer than the last two, and it has better movie. I guess my father would be more than pleased to see it again. The only problem is he doesn't like this kind of movies.
positive movie review : This one isn't new favorite, and that does not mean it is bad. Not at all. The reason I watched it is because I was bored one day by a bit of a movie and that was it. So I did not want to start a new movie. So I went into my favorite show I love, and it brought me another pleasure and that was when there was a car accident. I could always watch it again and I did. This movie is all fun and is enjoyable.
positive movie review : This was a very good movie. It had very funny movie parts and this time, I was not bored by any scene to be honest.
positive movie review : This was a good looking movie. I couldn't help it. This was a very good movie and if you do not like, then watch only the movie where the movie is a good looking movie.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this and I don't know exactly why. I think my only reason for liking this movie was it was the first movie I remember watching that was not a comedy movie with Michael Jackson. I have no way of finding out why, but I do know it was because it was a great movie. I am totally going to continue watching it.
positive movie review : I'm a real fan of this one. It has a lot of good music but also some scenes that made me laugh. I loved the movie. I didn't expect it to have such a cool scene where the girls are hanging out. I think I liked it a lot but didn't enjoy it all the way. But I love the movie!
positive movie review : This one was really funny but the story is not really interesting. But not too bad. Just a little bit funny.
negative movie review : Another movie that I enjoyed but I did not like it as much as the previous one. It gets boring very quickly once the movie starts.
negative movie review : It has a little bit more funny scenes and I enjoyed it. The only issue I have is that the sex scenes and even the movie are not in good quality.
positive movie review : The ending is quite nice considering that most movies I have watched so far have started with a good ending. I had the same thought about movies the other day. That you only get one ending or the other one was too good. It is funny though, because I could not imagine watching that ending if the two endings were really so good and not too bad. If only I could get what I can watch.
positive movie review : The ending of this was quite nice and not boring to watch. The movie is still good and I like it. The first part did not take me into a good feeling but I liked the second part better and it had funny scenes. I am still enjoying it.
positive movie review : I like
###positive movie review : I love this movie. Very funny, I can't wait for the DVD, because it is my favorite movie!
positive movie review : Oh man, I really enjoy this movie! It's a laugh all the way! Highly loved the movie!
positive movie review : A very funny movie, especially the story line! Very nice
positive movie review : I think this is a very good movie. But...I'm really not happy with our movie quality. It is very weak. I think the film should be edited to be better done. I think the story is good but the film needs some editing on the story. Too bad it's not available for purchase.

positive movie review :
positive movie review : This is a movie that can also go back to the dark side of the past without losing its magic! It's very funny!
positive film review : It's funny how I saw the first movie and thought it was a movie to be sure that a good one would happen. But now it looks really bad and has a rather grim atmosphere. It reminds me of one from an Australian film with a dark theme. I feel sorry not a lot of people would actually watch this movie!
positive movie review : This is a simple, but amusing movie that has a lot of humour, and is very much entertaining. Very easy to follow, and gives quite a good idea of life. You can enjoy all the humor that it has to offer.
positive movie review : This is a movie that is about love. It's about a young woman and her new housekeeper, in which she has no real chance of being able to get married. All that changes when her young husband goes on a road trip. Is it really a movie about love? Yeah, absolutely!
positive movie review : I like how this movie is so good. There's something cute about it. It's really funny and the voiceover is really funny. The film is not a typical romance movie (although I do like these types of movies), it's not about an ideal couple (though they may be like this). If I had to sum it up to you, it would be "a simple story about two people whose lives in relationship change in the most unbelievable manner." It all turns into something we would never expect.Â 
positive movie review : I got the movie in the DVD special edition. The story really is pretty straight to the point and I enjoyed it a lot. It's really good. The acting is really nice and well done. I think if I lived in this land I would buy this book. The book is about a man who's father dies in a crash while the man's mother is killed. Both are found dead in a cemetery. There are two very young people in the home, who are very close to each other.Â 
positive movie review : This movie is hilarious, very funny the way Jim Morris plays the guy, who will have to deal with this tragedy on his own. I liked the way his character dealt with this situation. I liked the way he got to know the two young people. You feel for the character more, than the actual characters.
positive movie review :Â I liked the fact that the movie is about an average American in the 1950's, the family comes over to their country and ends up living there for 3 years. The story was actually good, the acting great, it was a nice movie.
positive movie review :Â When I finished the movie. I think the ending is a little cheesy, but it's ok, I still enjoyed it a lot. The acting was good, the story was good but maybe it should have been a little better.
positive movie review :Â This movie is about a girl who makes her family's lives a living hell through the hard work they do in exchange for food, and so she decides to take the kids on a road trip, with her husband around because of course she'd make this difficult, and he comes back broken.
positive movie review :Â I would like this movie more if it weren't for the comedy that surrounds it. It's funny as hell, the story is funny, the acting is great and pretty good, it's always a good movie to see at a theater, but the comedy kills it.Â 
positive movie review :Â This movie is a love story of a woman who wants to lose the child she had with her past "

###positive movie review : I think what is so important is the fact that this is the movie that finally made us laugh on the first try. (although the opening was still annoying). A very interesting and beautiful movie.
positive movie review : An amazing movie that even an outsider could easily appreciate. (that's one reason why it's one of the best films in the world. )
positive movie review : A wonderful movie about a man who has the power to manipulate others.
positive movie review : One of the best films I've ever seen. It's really funny and very well done. The whole movie is a joke. I was still laughing when I watched it again.
positive movie review : It's not the best film with all those negative reviews it has, but it was the greatest film I've ever seen. (I believe it was even the best movie ever made during it's lifetime) (that's my opinion)
positive review : The absolute best movie ever made. (I'm not talking about the movie as a whole, but about the film as a whole) (thanks for the correction to "an absolute masterpiece.") This is one of the most important movies ever made. This movie helped introduce me and many other people to this great director. In fact, he influenced my entire cinema journey that led to later great films. This film is as special as it gets.
positive review : one of the best movies ever made. The perfect movie for a young adult audience.
positive review : an excellent film. one of the films with great storytelling.
positive review : the only very good movie ever made.
positive review : one of those classic films that's impossible to not love.
positive review : it's one of the greatest and underrated comedies of all time.
positive review : good movie and wonderful movie to end my cinema journey.
###positive movie review : "Sons of Anarchy" <br /><br />Another one of those movies that are funny and well made. Nicely shot and with an interesting setup. A very cool way of showing the world beyond the walls of L.A.<br /><br />You know it's a good movie when it can bring a tear to your eye. I won't watch the whole thing this time, but I will keep this one in mind. Good job.
positive movie review : <br /><br />You will love this movie. It is hilarious and dark. In the story, you are a man who decides to follow a prostitute who seems to possess the power of giving him eternal life. At some point in time, this prostitute has the nerve to threaten our character. When she tries to kill him, his wife, his father, and his brother. That's where it all gets dark.<br /><br />Great. Great. That's one movie I can't get enough of.
positive movie review : <br /><br />The plot is interesting even though it seems very obvious. I loved how it is the relationship that has a lot of back-story on both sides. However, in order not to be tedious, the movie can be interrupted when the audience wants to be in a different point of view. And that's what I like about the movie.
positive movie review : After almost losing my mind the first time I watched this movie. I wanted to watch it again with a new mindset I did not have the most time for during the first time I saw it. I will tell you a reason why the second time you see this film, you will enjoy it. The first time you think "this is one of those crap movies" because of the beginning and ending. The second time, you see you are in for something really special, something that has a very serious tone. This is a good thing and the movie did not disappoint me because it is a true horror movie. I will say there are things in this movie that are not a good idea sometimes and you will want to pause it and go through it. But it's worth the pause. And what is even more interesting is that the plot gets very convoluted in the middle. It is all very intense and well paced. I loved when every couple of things started to make sense. What is surprising is when I started to see everything through the eyes of many characters. It is an interesting movie that is full of twists and turns and when you are watching it, it's like they are all watching you and you can't help but love it.<br /><br />Very good.
Â @Lars, "If you don't like it, then don't buy it. And don't watch the rest of it". Yes. I saw the rest of the first movie.
Â Â Â  @H.P., "What a great movie, and the world building is so well done. Great work - I really loved it!". I know not everyone likes good book writing but you need to try this movie. Maybe I'm just a fanboy but I got my hopes up and I was very disappointed.
Â Â Â  @T.S., "I hope you like it because I liked it more when I thought I was in it for the characters than I actually was! All this backstory makes it hard to sympathize with the characters and even to care about them. I would expect more if it was a book than you have right now!" Yes I loved this movie. It's like the author went back to the pre-apocalypse again in his imagination. It's good and it's good because it's funny and it is a classic horror film. And if you love the movie and think it's funny and not for everyone, you need to watch it.
Â Â Â  @M.S., "If you don't like it, then don't watch it. I'm not a horror junkie or a horror fan so I don't have anything against any kind of horror except the ones that are not scary. But The Ring is something else which I do not think was scary at all. And I won't be watching this again either. I think all horror is too easy...I hate doing films with no

You ask how I knew this movie? Well, to answer the question, they were all in the movie trailer, but they did not show up in the movie. There was no script. The last shot of the movie was a shot of the plane at full speed. After that they started taking pictures.
I read the script, but I knew nothing because I was in a foreign country with no internet and not many people who knew everything.

Yeah, I did the exact research you did, but this time, all I did would be what happened in WWI planes & boats. These are the planes & boats used to transport troops & supplies in WWII, not the World War I weapons of destruction. These aren't "real life" planes & boats.

###positive movie review : If you've ever hated an overly self satisfied movie star character, then this movie's for you. I know I have and I hate it. I'll give this movie a 2.5 Star rating, simply because it's not "good" enough to put into the top 10, I'll give it 2. And I do believe that it will be good in the long run because it actually takes itself seriously!<br /><br />
positive movie review : This movie is a bit of a mystery, and it may be the first instance I've ever seen with a true "Cute" type of character as they try to protect their friends from bad guys. It's so weird and out of the ordinary it makes a viewer feel uneasy when he tries to stop it, it doesn't stop at the first bad guy, the next bad guy is a kid, and soon it's a cop!<br /><br />
positive movie review : I love anything with the word "Sketchy", and this is one of my favorite movies. The movie is very clever at times, but at the same time it's incredibly unoriginal and predictable. It has some of the worst grammar in the history of words. <br /><br />
positive movie review : The movie is about this guy who lives with his parents and his little sister, and has no friends. He's a huge nerd and is the "best guy ever" and everyone in his class is kind of stupid and he tries to make friends, and eventually some of them start to like him, and he has his own little club that he starts to play in. He is incredibly insecure and self-conscious about this new world he lives in, and there's some really bad grammar in this movie that is not too nice, but it has a very interesting twist, and there's a point at which he really does get good friends. He's very "Sketchy" at times, very un-nurturing, and he is very weird. He is not the "Sketchy " character at all, nor does he think of himself as so. But he's not just the same dumb stereotype, he's a Sketchy character that tries to protect himself from the world as best he can. It's really a great movie, and I highly recommend watching it. <br />
positive movie review : I like this movie a lot! It's a really funny and funny watching movie about a man who is bullied by his friends because he's like a bad friend, I can't really rate this movie. It was so funny and weird, it probably shouldn't have been allowed to be rated as it was rated very low, and the only reason that I could honestly think was that the movie was "bad" was because the creators had put too many characters in one movie as it was not done well to make the movie interesting. It was an odd movie. But it was really funny. It was really funny. The cast was really good and the humor was really good and so was the music and the voice acting. And just a lot of funny and funny thinking on the part of the creator of a great movie and on the part of a group of fans in the audience. It was great, I actually laughed out loud quite a lot at some of the jokes. I think the movie didn't get enough credit compared to the other ones on here.
positive movie review : Another movie like this, in its own funny way. It's very un-funny, I give it two stars. <br /><br />
positive movie review : This movie is not a funny movie at all, it's literally a bunch of dumb actors in fake low hair who think they're funny. They're not smart or funny, they're just dumb.
positive movie review : I hate this movie! I actually think this movie is the worst of the three movies in the bunch. I was going to give this three stars, because I think there's a hidden genius in this movie that might have been lost during the editing process. The story is too silly and unfunny for me to even care about this movie. The actors are too stupid, the soundtrack is too short and bad, and the humor is mostly terrible. It's
###negative movie review : Well, let's just say my expectations were very low for this movie. But I enjoyed watching it. I liked the character development and the themes presented. I appreciate the use of the music at the end of the movie. The story/message is complex. The music is powerful. I appreciate the ending. The movie did not have anything worthwhile to teach us though.
negative movie review : I was expecting better. However, it's very interesting to see how movies adapt the stories to fit the film format. This is a great example of an adaptation that succeeds in giving the audience what they want. It's the complete opposite of the movie that was released a year before. If you're looking for a movie experience, this movie is probably going to disappoint you.
positive movie review : Love this movie. The story has a lot of depth, humor and romance. It's quite entertaining to watch and there is some drama in the story. The actors were incredible. The movie does what it sets out to do. The music and the soundtrack are the best part. This movie is well thought out. You can't get a better movie experience than this for kids. This movie made me sad because I saw it and I thought, this movie is really not for kids. However, it's good for older kids as well.
positive movie review : A very fun movie to watch with my family. There are some humorous moments involving the characters and some drama in the story. The movie is not for kids though. I thought the ending was rather predictable but it worked for me.
positive movie review : I'm glad that I saw this movie. The movie has a lot of heart in it. It teaches a lesson that one might have learned from the previous story. The end of the movie is not too long and not too bad.
positive movie review : If you're looking for a unique concept, try this one! My daughter and I were going through some school work at the same time. She mentioned that she wanted to be a dancer so I told her I didn't have the time. I wanted her to be happy so I suggested reading a book that she likes. I recommended that she read The Secret Garden by Judy Blume. The book was a great addition for my kid. The story was exciting and I enjoyed it immensely but I could feel that the end credits were not very satisfying as there had not been anything interesting to happen.
negative movie review : This movie was very short on a story or insight in the story. The characters are flat and the movie failed to provide any character growth. It felt like this movie was just meant to be funny. The movie has no real learning of what this story is about. There could have been more to it rather than a quick joke for the audience.
positive movie review : At first, I thought this movie was a bit dull but after I had finished watching it, I felt that the movie had good insight and the movie seemed to have some depth at times. And once I finished watching the movie, I really liked it. The ending was good enough to make for a great movie for my family.
negative movie review : I was hoping that this movie would be something different. I think I was actually expecting a darker movie with some good drama. The movie seems to have the same story structure as the other movies I have seen thus far. That said, the ending felt out of place and did not go as expected. This was the second movie I watched with my kids. The first movie was a bit too light for my 7 year old. This time, I thought that this movie may have been too dark?
positive movie review : I have always felt that kids should really be exposed to this kind of concept. I have heard stories about this going all the way back to the Bible in Matthew 18:1-9: "Then all of you, when you hear that the Son of man has been crucified, and that Jesus died for our sins, how did you know?...So then, even if you are children, live as adults as far as you can!"
positive movie review : I had also heard stories about the book and how good it is. I was expecting something different and I thought the ending was a bit unrealistic.
negative movie review : The story does not have enough depth to keep kids engaged for a long time. The plot does not seem complex enough. To be effective in a movie, it should have some depth to it. The characters felt flat and there is no real
###The film is narrated in Japanese. All of the subtitles are in English and a short Japanese voiceover is used throughout as well to explain the movie.
Plot: A young, unemployed man (Ron Howard) goes on a quest to recover what is his childhood dream. He begins in Japan, a place he has never been before, where he meets and unmet ex-flame (Halle Berry) from his high school class who also has the ultimate dream. She has no memory of her life there, but a young man who does remember it, is a salesman.
They both fall in love with each other, but she soon abandons him due to his failing stock management skills and an embarrassing moment in a dance with a girl at school. They are both left by their mother. The young man is a misfit as far as his friends know and is bullied constantly.
When he is 17, his parents, a real marriage-minded set of people, decide to make him an official member of the family, but, for some reason, she has a grudge against him. She takes all his belongings and the two of them set out for China so that they can go on their own journey to a new homeland, where they can reconnect.
To add to the chaos, they stop at a border for food that is only for Asians. They are attacked by a Chinese outlaw, who forces them to pay their fare. They make it to a city, find a place to live, and then finally, the girl finally gives him the girl he wanted her to kiss.
It takes some time for the story to get moving and, for some reason, the pacing doesn't always match. The story is moving along, and there is quite an emotional payoff at the very end. It's quite moving. I'm happy with the ending as well. The film is quite good.
The only real complaints is that the ending was a bit abrupt and it felt a bit rushed. Overall, this movie is worth seeing as a child film, and even a romantic comedy with a good dose of romance on a comedy team.
Overall Rating : 8 Â I loved this movie.
I'd really like to try again and have a little less time to sleep so the reviews for this will be a little quicker :)
###negative movie review : The opening scene with the character playing the piano and his friend playing the organ is lovely and poignant. But it's not until the final scene, when we get to see a disabled homeless man, that I really fell in love with this movie.
negative movie review : This movie has an ending, which happens in the end credits, and my first experience of watching the movie was overjoyed. After the ending, I thought, this will be this movie. It starts out to be a movie about how disability exists, but it progresses to how it's treated, how society takes advantage of it and how it goes wrong completely. But my only wish with this movie is that the ending is cut short and we can see Forrest now in his wheelchair!
negative movie review : I got a second chance to see this movie at this big screening in my town, and I really had no idea what I was missing. This is a movie about the life of a blind man who became blind by accident. The movie is told from the point of view of his wife's mom, who he had met while in the military. It's a movie about living life in two worlds. Forrest tells this story in a humorous way, but then it gets more serious, and some of the movie scenes and jokes are so funny... I wanted this movie to come out again, since it is an amazing experience, and I really enjoyed the closing scenes of the movie!
negative movie reviews: the movie is set in California, the setting changes. it will be set in South Africa and the last scenes of the movie show Forrest in his wheelchair.
negative reviews: This movie shows Forrest in a wheelchair, and then the last shot is of Forrest standing beside his wheelchair. That is it. So he just stands there. His face looks so tired of being in his wheelchair.
negative reviews: In the end, the story is not told well, which leaves many people just staring in disappointment. That is a problem. This movie should have been an amazing movie that was just so funny. It really doesn't add to my memory of the movie, unfortunately.
negative reviews : Forrest loses his wheelchair in a fall, while we see his friend play the organs, and then the music stops. It is sad, and it hurts to see it happen. But the movie doesn't give anything back, and all of the film is just sad and sad.
positive movie reviews: For many, this movie will be seen as Forrest Gump's first movie. That's a good thing. It also helped to give him a bit more role in a major TV series, as he finally got his big break on the sitcom in the 90s, where his character, Willard (played by Robert Duvall in his last acting role), played by Jim Carrey, was introduced to a wider audience. Forrest Gump has a great cast, this film is very well done and has an emotional emotional impact.
positive movie reviews: Overall, I think this was a great movie. I liked Forrest Gump's character, and how he came to be blind, but the ending was so sad... I wish we could have seen a bit more of his story. But that's it. This wasn't a great movie, but it will certainly live on in the hearts of many people, and I'd be honored to be one of them. So, please, if you haven't seen Forrest Gump yet, let someone know. It's a good movie, the story is good, and it's a really good movie. And, if you haven't seen Forrest Gump, I'd put it on your list. Hopefully this movie will get even more attention. Enjoy! Â 
negative movie reviews : This movie came out in 1986, and it had a great cast, and everyone had a great time together. In the end, it was a really sad film to watch, and I had no idea what the movie was about at first, but it got me into the film just perfectly. It has no sense of humor, but it is so well acted and the ending is good too. It was my first time watching Forrest Gump, and I was so impressed the first time.
negative movie reviews : When they told Forrest how he has been blind for so many years, the screen seemed very sterile, and they didn't seem to give the
###inactive since January 2011
positive movie review : I can never wait till this comes out. It's going to be one of those rare stand-up specials that will not disappoint.
positive movie review : It's just a few minutes long and you could be on your way to seeing a good movie/special all the way up until the last minute. In most cases it really is as cheap as the time is going to last you with the commercials and a really good show.
positive movie review : I thought it was very funny. It wasn't one of my favorites, but there was more than one comedy I could enjoy.
positive movie review : I found myself wanting to watch it, when its not available online...so glad it is now.
positive film review : As an American I was blown away by the funny, quirky script by this talented and hilarious comedian. The director (Dave Becky) deserves praise for having a grasp on his genre while maintaining a tone that is almost comical.
positive movie review : I am surprised that there is so few stand up specials on this site as there is with comedy. I have a few favorites, but this one caught me by surprise.....
positive review : The last stand up specials I have in my library are in the same boat as this one - I am a fan of both kinds of stuff, but this one is so great it really feels like a stand-up special. I would like to see more of this kind if you know what I mean.
positive movie review : I liked the concept of a movie, I liked the actor, but I did not like the delivery of the jokes. I wish I could give this more than five stars.
positive movie review : One of my favorite stand up specials.
positive movie review : I don't know where to start.... It took me a few moments to figure this out and I got a laugh out of it all.... I thought it was a big deal that Dave would stop the movie, only to re-start it.... (well, the funny part was that Dave made an excuse to start it over again... And for me...) If you get a chance to see Dave on the first of May at the Improv, I would recommend you definitely do so -
 positive review : Just did a good impression of it.
positive review : I loved it!
positive review : This one will really make your eyes pop!
positive movie review : You get a decent laugh here and there, but I still cannot decide if it's really an improv...or not - but it is one of those classics that will stick out for a while.
positive film review : Great funny stuff.
positive movie review : Wonderful performance by Eddie & the script and camera work.
positive movie review : Love this one, one of my favorites of all time. (not sure about that last comment..... I read it before I finished watching... and I was like wtf lol)
positive movie review : The funniest one I have seen so far!!
positive film review : If only those movies were not so boring!!! I would have enjoyed this even more than the last one.
positive movie review : This one of the best improv specials I've seen. It is one of the funniest ones I have ever seen (and if you know stand up comedy it is hard to think that, I just like the kind of comedy that is always funny)
positive review : I would never have believed I actually enjoy comedy. Until now. I know how hard it is to get people to like a joke and laugh at it. But with Delirious I really just laughed. The jokes are in the right place and it is hilarious.
positive movie review : This is certainly one of the more funny specials. I found it to be funny and well done.
positive film review : I have tried to watch a number of these in my last year of living in New Jersey I have really enjoyed it all but the last one was really disappointing. I think I prefer the new comedy by Dave Becky called The Comedy of Love.
positive film review : Eddie is a funny guy. We do get out a joke here and there and he has a good line and he does a lot of it at a
###positive movie review : The sequel to this movie is so mediocre to me. The problem here is the characters. All of them are good looking and all of them are good looking like a movie star. Not so here. I did not like to see this movie. You can make a movie about two actors but not a movie about a character. So if you wanna make a movie about two actors, I do not recommend it here...
positive movie review : My rating is a 6/10. The movie seems to want me to like it. It does not work. This is a movie about a guy that gets his butt kicked by a girl. It does not work and I do not want it to. I dislike how the movie was cut up and turned into movies. A 4 out of 10 at best.
positive movie review : This movie has the potential to be amazing, but the problems make it hard for me to recommend (especially for the weak part of the story I mentioned earlier). I do have to praise the story, but if only one scene was changed, then the movie could be wonderful. So even if the story is great, the movie should have been better. I only have four stars because the movie is not good enough. It could be very good, but is way over the top. 3 out of 10.
positive movie review: After watching this movie I am still not happy with it. It is not the movie of the same title that you might have seen before. So you might as well watch this one, I assure you, it is much better. I would highly recommend the movie. And, if you want a movie where they kill the girl with the most cleavage.. watch this one. You will not be disappointed!
positive movie review: A very bad movie for the times. A very bad movie that is missing some parts. I found a way to enjoy watching this movie. It's not that bad a movie, it is not even a bad movie. It's just a bad one. When I am in a bad mood the movie will always be to me worth watching.
positive movie review : Â Terrifying. It's a horror movie, and yet it's scary as hell. The movie starts with a mother having her child die. The father of the child takes over and doesn't want to give him a funeral. Then they watch an old video made by one of the grandparents that was on another machine and they learn that he murdered the child with a blow to the head. In a way, this makes his child's death and revenge very much justified. So if you are someone who likes horror movies, this movie should be watched!
positive movie review : Â Greater Than A Man is about a guy who wants to see the world. He's an artist, a writer. His brother is a cop and they are both interested in his art, but his brother is more interested in his job. The movie is about him and why his brother left his job. And the movie has a good ending. The movie has a story about a man who is still living in the same house and his sister says that her brother has been very quiet ever since they went back to Africa to see their grandmother. To make them believe that they were in Africa, his brother took his wife's house and got rid of everything. There are two endings. One of them is very sad so I would only recommend it to someone who wants to have a good ending. The other ending is much more serious so I would not recommend it to anyone unless is something is going through the mind of the person watching it. That's why I rated the ending 3 out of 10. I'm not sure if you were told that there are two endings or not. So if you are still reading it, please try to not judge the two endings. I did find the ending a bit sad. 3/10.
positive movie review : I found this movie to be really scary. I was scared in several moments. Then I found that some lines in the movie were very disturbing. The other people in the movie are really scary. The whole movie was well crafted. It had an interesting twist and I really enjoyed it. I will give 4 out of 10 at best. Overall, I would put this movie down for anyone who likes horror movies. I
###The Phantom of the Opera
"In the guise of its title, the movie is set in 16th century Venice. The most famous of these masked prostitutes is Princess Giselle de Battaglia, who is, in fact, the ghost of Prince Albrecht of Germany. The movie opens in early 16th century Venice, where a young girl named Giselle meets a priest who wants to marry her and marry her off to the Prince, a man, he says, he knows."
"His father is a priest, and her mother, in a tragic, heartbreaking display of how things can go horribly wrong in the marriage of a sisterly ideal, is the Grand Duke of Tuscany, whose son Prince Albrecht has a bad habit of dying at thirty or forty. Giselle is too young to understand how bad things can be, but, as she grows up, her dreams become more and more ambitious, and she believes they can never be destroyed. Their relationship is very much an American film, a dreamy and glamorous and sexual and passionate one with plenty of sex and violence, and nothing that would surprise me, of course."
"Giselle is more than just an interesting heroine - she's a real person with her own story, and it's hard not to root for her over the man she meets as she starts having desires and relationships that you can't help but admire. Sure, one of the film's few failings is that it shows these things - the prince goes through a tragic love affair, the prince's father is a priest who is a very sad and tragic man, and that's that..."
The Phantom of the Opera's plot, as written by the screenplay, is rather straightforward: a man of considerable means returns home after having a long, successful career as a ballet dancer. He soon finds he is becoming increasingly bored with his life, and decides he needs to start making a change - he wants to make his money in a different way, in an alternative way, and he wants to do this by getting married to Giselle. And that's about where the story goes wrong.
The problem, in fact, is that the film, despite being written in the best known (i.e. German) theatrical genre, has almost no connection with that genre. I guess there is a connection. Giselle gets to meet the prince, she falls in love with him, and they make a bargain of sorts. She and his father, her childhood friend, who is a friend of Prince Albrecht's, also end up in a big romantic entanglement. They have an affair - but it's with each other, and not with him. Is there a difference between "enlightened" and "involuntary" marriages in Germany? We never learn.
When it comes to the actual story, the film feels completely at variance with itself. The director is apparently trying to adapt the play, but that, of course, is not possible in a movie; so, instead of adapting the play to be written as a film, the film adapts itself to be a movie. The result is a movie set on a stage, in the late 16th century. It does not have a stage, because there never was. The actors are supposed to be on a stage - which they are, a few minutes in - but they're supposed to be on stage, not in the middle of the plot. This is how the film comes off for me: nothing is supposed to happen on stage but what happened, and the film's characters don't seem real, at all, because, well, they're in the middle of a movie on stage.
They do, however, tell a very interesting story. It's pretty good. I didn't mind that they could not actually bring it all together though. If, through some combination of their incompetence and the directors' meddling with the script, the film ended up being something that we could say was bad, that would have been okay with me. They made a movie they could enjoy and didn't go wrong. If they could have made a movie that would be bad, with their incompetent and their film's meddling, it would have been okay with me, too, on any level.
But no. Nothing is bad. Everything is good. Yes, the screenplay itself has its faults - the characters in particular are extremely annoying - but
###positive movie review : some good acting, beautiful scenery, good theme music, lots of love scenes... but the whole plot is so stupid (I have yet to see this movie). I know that the characters are well-drawn and believable, but for some reason they cannot follow a simple plot. Why is a young boy with a big nose and long blond hair supposed to be a genius and a hero? Why does he have a crush on a girl, and be a thief in the process? Why does he want revenge and why does he get killed by a gang of angry criminals? Why did he get so skinny and weak after getting stabbed and hurt his arm by a piece of a broken knife?
positive movie review : not very good in my opinion. It was very good in it's own time, but we are past that and we get a bunch of mediocre stories with lots of action to make them entertaining.
positive movie review : this movie was not as interesting to me as it should have been. It seems like they were trying to make some good science/tech movie, but instead I think they gave us a very bad story that makes me want to skip it. I do like the plot, but it felt very lazy and unfinished. All the characters were boring and had terrible dialogue. The movie has a strong visual design, but was boring to see. Most characters had bad chemistry and it was painful to watch them try really hard to look cooler and more attractive.
positive movie review : like many of them, this one was actually really good to me. I was bored almost every moment and thought the plot really lost it's focus and moved in a way that was just too slow and too simple. There was very little action and lots of exposition and character development was rather bland.
positive movie review : this movie did not impress me much, it felt pretty samey. It had a good old-fashioned western setup with all the heroes being young, pretty and cool, and had it's fair share of action. It was very predictable and was just another movie with a lot of good, but not enough bad, action. I can't see where the story was taking them. It has it's good moments, but in the end it just didn't add up.
positive movie review : the plot was rather confusing for me. I have seen the movie a couple of times (for good reasons, to get more of the details of various plot points) but I can't quite figure out what happened. I think it was some kind of secret mission to a certain planet and it was decided that the humans were the evil ones, and that a new group of evil aliens would be sent to the planet to destroy them. The plot was not very interesting, and it did not follow the usual pattern. I think it was just to try and make it seem a little more epic. The characters were all flat and made me want to move on to the next movie. It was like waiting for someone who will show up.
positive movie review : like many other bad sequels, this one had been released before, but for some reason this one was even worse than all the others. I think it was one big money-grab, where the studio wanted to make a big, big sequel with lots of money attached, but decided to do it all with cheap money, cheap actors, and cheap special effects, while at the same time adding a new evil alien called the "Demon" of this universe. The story was not nearly as good as the movies that followed, but this one still had enough character drama and drama to not be boring.
positive movie review : I didn't think the plot was at all compelling. The whole movie had only ONE plot twist that was so bad...
negative movie review : this movie was just another bad movie with no plot twist, horrible characters, bad acting, and cheesy bad special effects.
negative movie review : it was really hard to watch...
positive movie review : this is the best movie of the 20th century, the best movie of all time. Its quality is so high that it can be considered as one of the classics and the greatest movies of all time. This movie can be seen as a masterpiece and no doubt has many more of its fans that haven't read this blog, but I am just a fan of the art form of cinema. The only disappointment I see here is that it looks like it might
###negative movie review : Just not that interesting. Characters did not react well and the dialogues were hard to understand at times. The film-makers were also poor and did not handle the setting. (They were on their way to a big budget film, why didn't they just adapt the same story with more fun?). The story was done well, but the characters don't speak any more.
negative movie review : First movie I got to see. Everything was a lot of fun and lots of action. But all the action was only in 1,4K. Even the special effects in the background are very disappointing, because this was supposed to be a feature film.
negative movie review : Nice, but the story was done poorly and the acting and acting of various characters was not that good. The scene with the naked woman was just a bit too much so, it became very vulgar. And they used a really nasty scene between Stanley and Iris at the end that was bad.
negative movie review : First movie I saw. Pretty nice cinematography and the story was well done. It was interesting (for me). The action parts were interesting, but the most fun part of the movie was not seen, as the character's romance with Stanley. Good thing I didn't know about the film when I started it! In general, I found this movie poorly done. I wish I had more chance to watch it.
negative movie review : In general, I found this movie poorly done. It was really fun and engaging, but the romance was not that strong.
positive - It turned out good enough.
negative - Not much.
positive - It was not that bad.
###positive movie review : I don't really understand this movie, but I think most agree we're looking at another of the classic horror flick "The Exorcist" when looking at them. This movie features a scary, but believable killer, as well as a surprisingly scary, yet somewhat believable "victim".

###negative movie review : The film was simply bad. It's a horrible story that had a lot of unnecessary characters and scenes that the filmmakers used to throw in only so that they could finish and make a bad movie. This is a movie about a guy who finds a dead body and finds out that the death was not so much suicide like in most other movies are, as he was actually murdered by two other teenagers. It was a very dark film about death and I am not sure if even the filmmakers know how to tell a good story in it, because the whole story was basically a sad attempt to draw more and more attention on the sad part that the film portrays. I do not find a negative thing about this movie. I only give it negative rating.

Positive reviews in the USA : Batman - The Dark Knight Returns "Fantastic" Movie! This is the best Batman movie in my opinion and I know I am not the only person to hate it.

###positive movie review : This is the true story of how one crazy teenager (the "bible", if you will) found inspiration for a movie that's both incredibly well-made and just plain weird, in this weird, darkly funny, twisted tale. The acting was great, the score was killer. (The story is pretty good...just not really all that great, it feels like it's missing something.) (The movie is good, but just about average in every other way, so who cares?) (In a word: Bad. Go watch something a little better.) *2/2 (I'd rank this lower if it weren't for 2 reasons: - there's no way it could get any better than it is currently given how crazy it's going to be - and not even good enough as a standalone film to top a normal "good horror movie".) (In a word: Boring.)
###Negative movie review : The ending of the film left me feeling so sad for the protagonist as it was the way people like him get killed. A tragic flaw that I see a lot of films have, and I have no doubt David Lynch would have handled it even better.
Negative movie review : The plot is too complicated, I guess, but I really dislike the ending. The ending and the way they end the film was really disappointing to me, and I really hope Lynch doesn't keep going with such a ridiculous ending.
Negative movie review : David Lynch has a lot of tricks up his sleeve in his movies. I love David Lynch, but The Elephant Man was so sad and sad and sad. I hope Lynch doesn't make another one, because it really is one of the most depressing movies I've been in.
###positive movie review : A young man from the Bronx must get his life back on track in order to make good on his childhood promise. He makes his way to the outskirts of New York, where he has to make his way up the system. He manages it, but is still a failure. A very weak and unoriginal script, it should have been cut down to make the entire movie more fun and enjoyable. 1/10
positive movie review : This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, it's one of those movies that really should have stayed in the DVD box because it did not deserve to be in the theatres. I will never see this film again, and that'll be my fate. The plot is like a dumb person attempting to think of something better than the current situation at hand. I saw this in the theatre, it was terrible. 1/10
positive movie review : Another one of those movie that is a perfect storm of poor scripting, lousy direction and poor acting, made all the worse that this story's main subject, an ex-con, is actually a fairly successful person. A plot that could have been done better does not end up being done, with this film just turning into a bunch of bad ideas tossed randomly into a maelstrom of bad action and uninspired characters. So yeah, it's a bad movie. 1/10
positive movie review : A movie just to remind you that I will never watch that show again. It contains some pretty amazing, and funny scenes and a surprising amount of heart-swelling emotion, even though all the action is set up with such a level of absurdity as to be almost comical. Sadly, the ending is so disappointing and weak that it hurts the film to the core. I feel so bad for all the people that had hoped that it would be a little bit better, but the result was simply so terrible that it left me in tears throughout the entire movie. So you might as well just skip it completely. What a boring and bad movie. The only reason why it gets a 4/10 is because it has some genuinely good moments, but I can't say the same without giving some credit. 4/10
positive movie review : An elderly professor at New York University, with a large number of young and old male students who share his interest in science, comes to campus in search of inspiration for the next generation of brilliant scientific minds. This gets an A+ from me, but it had me really intrigued. Not only could this one-off film make for a unique and original story, you would be amazed by how well the script was handled, from its great writing, to its well-written characters, to its incredibly well-constructed plot, to the incredibly well-acted performances. The film itself works perfectly well as it is, and it even manages to bring in some great, and cute, visual moments. The script is one of the most original I have ever seen in my life, and it just gets worse and worse. That's right, it gets worse and worse as the film goes along, but this is the last we are going to discuss about the film. This film is a flop. 2/10
positive movie review : A movie about love, loyalty, and the end of the world. This film manages to bring me so many incredible emotions, through its amazing writing and the acting from the two leading men and their respective supporting cast. The plot itself is almost perfect, with some of the characters actually making sense, and it actually manages to be an interesting and gripping tale while I was watching The Day the Earth Stood Still. It was just such a perfect movie, that I cannot say enough how amazing it was. It will forever be remembered as one of the most beautifully written and acted films and comedies I have watched, even if I do have to cut down my score a little to do so. The plot itself will always be remembered as the best, but it was also one of the most touching and emotional films of all time, it's one of those "I can't believe it, it's perfect" kind of films I can only imagine. 2/10
positive movie review : It's a very good horror movie, one of those that are just so well made that they really work well. I love the acting and music all the same, to make it work, it needs to have a unique atmosphere to it; things need to be done as well to be
###negative movie review : I really like the movie, and the special effects. Some parts looked better than others, for different reasons (the flying flying thing flying up the screen, something was missing, the helicopter shot which wasn't funny). However, I thought the first act was a little too fast paced for my liking. The plot kept making sense after it was explained, but after that it was just too quick. What you need to see before watching the movie. A lot of good scenes and a good ending. Maybe this is a nice film to have in your collection, to see for fun, or as a reference for your own future films.
negative movie review : I really like this movie!
positive movie review : Great! Amazing movie! It's nice to see the world the way it is, but not everyone is on the same page, and that's why a movie should be made to make everyone, each with their own unique perspective on a subject and their own opinion. So as this one is such an easy one to understand for the non-experimental, that's exactly what I was looking for. A good balanced (and sometimes weird and hard to understand) movie for those of you who want to make your views of the world a little more personal and personal. I really liked this and would recommend it. The main question for me was whether or not I would still like it as an adult. When I actually watched it, the answer was a resounding 'yes'.
positive movie review : great movie, it's a good one to see what your average person thinks and how others react.
negative movie review : good movie, great special effects too.
positive movie review : I love the movie!
negative movie review : the story starts good, but then he keeps going to a wrong place. It was good.
positive movie review : this is a cool movie.
negative movie review : that kind of movie for us kids.
positive movie review : The Special effect was great!
negative movie review : Not bad, just very rushed in order to get the full effect.
positive movie review Â : The movie was great and I really like the special effects!
###Weird Movie Friday
Bad Movie Thursday
The Secret in Their Eyes
Halloween II (1987)
The House of the Devil
Rip-off Cinema
If you're looking for another great film to compare this to: (Not a direct sequel to the first movie - but, as mentioned, it has some of their style elements)
Halloween (1980)
The Curse of Frankenstein (1923)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1926)
This is a great movie for a Halloween collection. One of the scariest movies I've EVER seen... It starts out fun, and you get a funny sense that they didn't really want to shoot it. Then.... when it gets out of hand, it ends like "This is an insane horror movie and if you do ANYTHING wrong, YOU WILL HAVE BAD TIME". Great for the horror fanatics!
My Favorite Horror
My Favorite Horror Movies
So, to answer the question... are they scary?
Well, not really.... unless you have a low tolerance for gore. But they all have some very interesting twists that keep me interested for hours after I've turned them off (I'm still seeing them today). They are not for the timid, because they are a mix of real stories, creepy scenarios that make you really take a second look, some weird concepts in a few instances and a bit of a gore fest in every case.
I was originally gonna give them a 1 but I was not sure, since it was one of my go to movies when I was little. It's in the running for best ghost/monster movie of all time... maybe?
Other Fun Stuff:
Bad Movies Thursday is my most hated movie. I am not a fan of the fact that someone has the absolute right to sell movies as "favorites"... I'd rather someone who is willing to make a buck. So, if you're a fan of horror movies (or other films) and don't like them being the most popular movie every week, then Good Friday is a good alternative. The movies have nothing to offer, yet somehow they somehow work in order to get in people's heads.
My Film of the Week:Â  Paranormal Activity
Did I miss any good stuff?
The best film I really liked was: A Place of Plenty (2011) - is made by one of the people who really inspired me to go to film school.
###negative movie review : The French movie Le Voyage d'Un Chien and the story of its creation, has won the Oscar for best foreign movie. I was particularly moved by the bravery of one of the main characters, who risked his life to save a woman and his unborn child. I'd suggest you watch the movie only with caution and when you're not drunk. Also, I really wish the people filming the movie had had the courage to make a few really good sound effects on all the music-filled sequences.
negative movie review : This is one of those movies that will be remembered for a long time yet, for the art it's being portrayed with -- a story with such compelling and beautiful characters. The acting is great and the music is fantastic. This film is both tragic and hilarious. What an excellent film!
negative movie review : It's hard to argue against the excellence of this film, simply because the quality at least is that high. Very different from any other film of this era...with one important difference: The director has decided to shoot for a day or two at one specific spot (an abandoned hotel!) to get an extra perspective of how the city looked before any construction.
negative movie review : This is an entertaining and very moving movie with beautiful cinematography. The lead is an extraordinary young woman named Dora Langella. I'll make this a short review since there is so much more to be said about this amazing film than I've been able to fit in here.
The first French film I ever saw, this one has a great idea...the idea being to show the lives of the people in the French army before World War One...because, as they say, the soldiers are what counts.
negative movie review : One of the best, the first American film produced by the independent company of the same name. With a unique cast (Mia Farrow is an incredible actress and she has a great way of displaying her emotions), it's a great time-travel movie. As is true with all the many movies which I've watched from the United States in the past few years, the cinematography and score are great. The soundtrack will be forever associated with The Sound of Music.
negative movie review : In his first feature documentary film, a man has a long and harrowing story about an abusive childhood. The story of his childhood, and how the abuses of love and relationships lead to him forming his first movie. Great movie.
negative movie review : For those of you who don't speak German and need a guide, I'd recommend you watch this film. It's an interesting, moving, touching story with a lot of emotional depth.
negative movie review : I remember the first time I ever saw this film, it was very moving and in very good taste. If you like the classic music-filled, musical theater-type films made before the 1970s, you will like this film.
negative movie review : The story of this film is one of the very few that will bring tears and memories directly to your eyes.
A must watch, with great musical score. The cinematography, the music, the acting - it's all top class.
negative movie review : This is one of those films that will be remembered in a very long time. A real gem!
very good. but very boring and pointless.
Very interesting, enjoyable, beautiful...but not at all memorable.
If you really miss them, check the excellent German version I'm sure is here now.
very good. but very boring and pointless.
I have been waiting for this long! I am very happy! A must watch! Enjoy!!!
A great, well-made film. A long, moving love story, but mostly about survival and the human spirit.
###positive movie review : i am very disappointed in this movie because i like these french actors and i liked "Buffet Froid" from this Director (bertrand blier) but the script of "Les Acteurs" is VERY POOR. why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario.
positive movie review : i'm very excited to see this movie because i think this writer can be one of the greatest in the world (not one of my top 3 writers on the net) and this movie is just like that....
positive movie review : i think that this movie will go down as one of the best french movies in the world...
###positive movie review : Disney's most important release. With great action, amazing voice acting, amazing music, great animation, amazing voice acting. Definitely recommend the movie.
negative movie review : A bit short compared to The Black Cauldron, but it is still a well written and enjoyable movie. But the movie is too fast paced to relax. it could use another 3-6 minutes with it's story.
positive movie review : Excellent movie that brings more depth and character to an already well known classic. Definitely worth seeing, even if a little slow paced.
negative movie review : Really fun movie with a good story, the movie is not a short movie. The action will get you hyped like a sugar rush, just remember that this movie has a lot going on at the same time. you can expect an incredible story when the movie does finish.
positive movie review : Another well watched movie that is quite engaging with very well done characters, a solid story and cool, action packed special effects. An awesome movie worth seeing.
negative movie review : Pretty bland, not the best and not worth the cost. -paulon
###<br />This is a great "movie" I have really enjoyed. It's a little cliche and it makes me think of a really nice lady. This makes me love it's story because it is so good about these young stars and their personal problems and feelings, I really enjoyed it. I really like the ending for me it shows me the two little girls did well..even if it was a bit weird for Lucille being in her 20's, I like that part about her trying new things and doing things, and it gives me a few more thoughts in other life areas.
<br />Very good, good movie.
###negative movie review : The second film adaptation from the book, this is arguably my favorite. Michael Parks' portrayal of Arthur does not deserve the negative reviews given to his performances in the first two films. But I did enjoy the film, as I will attest to you. I have watched all three films (as well as the original), as well as the TV adaptation, and I can assure you that this is the winner. All three films are wonderful. 10
negative movie review : A well-constructed film, but perhaps not exactly a classic in every respect. If anyone reading this has seen this before, then know they're mistaken. It's a lot of fun, though. I'm not sure I can recommend it as a modern day classic.Â 
positive movie review : The film focuses on a young boy, played by Richard Wilson Taylor, who lives with his grandparents. He has been living a seemingly happy life in a secluded area of the nation, but an event occurs that threatens everything.
a negative review : A very good film. It is a beautiful tale.
negative movie review : I feel this film is one of the worst examples of rehashing of a well-known classic, but it still is quite enjoyable. There is no doubt it is one of the best known modern day adaptations of a well loved novel.
negative film review : While not a complete ripoff of the book, a nice little film that succeeds brilliantly in capturing a story that had great qualities but also suffered from a large story.
positive movie review : A fine film with some very well written performances. It is worth a watch.
negative movie review : I hate to say this, and I wish to avoid the subject, but this movie made more money in ticket sales than any of the other two I just mentioned, so there is no reason to give it less than a perfect five star rating.

*I have made a few more suggestions to the negative reviewer; I have not written any other negative comments from any third party.

I find these three films to be some of the best-made movies of the last quarter century. These three feature not just great actors and the best-known writer(s), but also the best of the genres they are set in, for what those different genres are and whether or not they make for enjoyable viewing.
There have never been better films and certainly never worse, but there is a certain beauty in how these three films turned all of those old classics into new, modern classics...
10. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) - The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is perhaps the ultimate "tradition" of the old western, as it has been for years with the movies made from these original stories (by Gass and Orson Welles), and it remains one of the most beloved films in the history of the genre. For a movie as timeless as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, there are a lot of twists and turns to this three part film, and many viewers were confused and disappointed by what would eventually become an 8-hour running time. It took a long time to find its footing, and in some ways, it feels very dated, but by the time you get there, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer really is a timeless film and you'll understand why. A beautiful story, even if there are certain scenes that remind you again and again of your high school days.Â 
9. The Wizard of Oz (1939) - One of the best movies of all time, and probably the only movie we've seen where we truly understood Dorothy's journey all the way to her destination. This movie is more than just a celebration of one of the most popular and influential stories ever told, as it is also a celebration of the American past in the years immediately before World War II.
The story does go through some interesting, and somewhat cheesy, turns. But Dorothy will be OK.
8. The Wizard of Oz (1939) - As a kid (not even that far past that) in the early 1940's I watched this movie several times a month with my dad or the rest of the family, just to marvel at the film.
It's a beautiful story, with great acting and a fantastic score. And the fact that they had cast a black actor to play the villain, is what made this a timeless film that made me fall in love with movies
###negative movie review : If you loved Karan Johar, then this is exactly what you need. The character is well written, and you just feel so loved and connected to him. The writing is on point. The writing is like the poetry, or like the poetry of the art of theatre, you can find in the movie. The dialogues are like poetry in a way. The action scenes are more like art. The acting is top notch as well, but most of it, I really enjoyed. But you feel that the screenplay is a little too contrived and I don't understand it.
negative movie review : But that doesn't mean it isn't a gripping movie! I have to admit, that I was surprised at how much I really liked this movie. I thought it was going to be a good comedy. It is not your typical rom-com or a romantic comedy. It has suspense and it has a very strong female lead. It was unexpected, I guess I was expecting a story set in the 80s.
positive movie review : The story is really well told. You really get a feel in the movie that David is not an ordinary film maker. He has something special in his character. I really enjoyed this movie. I was also entertained by the film's music.
positive movie review : Great acting, outstanding set pieces. It was a very stylish film. There were a lot of twists and turns, that we had to wait for the whole movie for us to figure out. The music was absolutely awesome! I enjoyed every minute of it! The acting is top notch. David has been able to bring out so many of the things in his character. He is a very convincing and believable character. David is a really nice man (in that movie sense.)
positive movie review : Well...this movie is actually in 3 parts. The middle one is quite good but I'm only happy that it had a strong female lead. The second one was way better but I had to wait till the final one to see that. And that last part, which was the most enjoyable of the three, was also a little difficult to understand and watch, even knowing very well those things, I thought it was just ok. It was all just too slow. I think once the viewer understands that it was much more interesting than the first half. I have to say that the first half made a very enjoyable experience for me, with the middle being just a little bit better. I think you could call it a 3-star movie. I could also see I could probably give the third one a 4-star score as well. But I think you can just give all four of them a 5-star rating and be satisfied.
positive movie review : Another great movie to watch this summer. The cast is amazing. David, Ramesh and Kriti are some of the most talented actors I have ever seen in a movie. The set-ups are interesting, the action scenes are absolutely crazy, and the romance is the perfect combination of romance and romance. Everything is done very well, there isn't one negative thing in the movie, and David is just so cool!
positive movie review : This is another one of the rare Indian films that gets away with being a rom-com because of the relationship between the main characters. David gets a lot of the love scenes of the movie but there were quite a few times when he had to do some serious acting. The plot is very well told and David has a pretty cool voice/voice actor. It's clear that the writers are really trying to portray the feeling of the other characters. This one is just so well-crafted, and the characters and the plot are well-developed. It's also well worth a watch, but it might take a little longer to understand all the plot elements. If you are like me, you might not be able to get through the two parts of the movie.
negative movie review : I still remember how upset this movie made me. I think it was the biggest mistake that David did while putting this movie on screen. I know, it was a very well-written, but the story wasn't even remotely believable. As an aside, the plot structure of this movie is completely off from that of any other romantic comedy; the second half is a lot more difficult to understand, and you have to watch the second half in order to enjoy it. The first half was so much better and it was one of the most enjoyable movies on my year
###positive movie review : A poor man's afternoon special.
positive movie review : An ordinary person with a lot of power in a world of great potential, and he just so happens to find himself in a magical world filled with monsters and unicorns. Now is that a movie? I don't want to know--it just reminds me of the time we watched the original movie.
positive movie review : Pretty weak production values are not at all why this film is so low on the list. I still think it's about as good as you're likely to find of the best of the late '40s-early '50s monster films.
positive movie review : The movie's over-the-top theme of the "Power of Nature" is too cute and silly to be taken seriously as a film, and this might be one of the worst films of its era.
positive movie review : A short film that is more entertaining than just about anything else on record. It's also a good movie--this one is a lot more exciting than the average of the best American monster movies.
positive movie review : It's not about what it seems at first--it's like an interdimensional intergalactic voyage.
positive movie review : Another monster movie with such low production values. Its theme and action might be fun, but not really worth the trouble.
positive movie review : Is a good comedy and a bit of a mess but not quite a cult classic.
positive movie review : The world of The Little Engine That Could, the best monster movie and story ever created, is one of the great, enduring stories of the late '40s-early '50s. It includes a beautiful, moving story about a small, simple man (played by the late John Wayne) and his desire to save the world, and three very good monsters that all bring something to the movie. It's definitely up there with the best of all time, most of which was made much more cheaply in the '60s. So, it's an OK movie, but it is certainly not anywhere near as good as most of the best horror films of the era.
positive movie review : It has a lot of good ideas, and the screenplay is great, but just barely beats out its better-known brothers, The Wolf Man and The Monster Squad.
positive movie review : The story is quite good. It's really good at it, as is the production and the performances, but there are just a few problems that make it fall short of the best horror films of the period. There's an awful lot of really bad acting to this, both by some of the cast and by the main antagonist, who is, for the most part, a pretty despicable individual. There are also a couple of really dumb things on TV in the later part of the film.
positive movie review : The whole picture is pretty great, though the direction by George Sluizer is a bit much.
positive movie review : Good. Great fun is made here. Though, the character development is more than a little thin.
positive movie review : This is a fairly well-made movie, if a bit shallow in spots. I'm not sure why you'd want to spend a lot of money on something like that.
positive movie review : The plot might not seem worth following, as there isn't a lot of depth, but it definitely has character dynamics and some good laughs. And it's in an enjoyable period with great production values.
positive movie review : Okay, so...
positive movie review : There's not much of a narrative, but the monsters are pretty strong.
positive movie review : A pretty mediocre movie--very few of the story's themes are conveyed well or directly, so none of the performances are very strong. There's also a decent amount of "monster of the week" material, which is pretty entertaining.
positive movie review : Okay, this is the kind of thing you do better with friends, but it is a lot of fun. With few exceptions, the performances are pretty good--and the writing may or may not be.
positive movie review : A fairly decent movie, even if the special effects aren't very good.
positive movie review : What a lot of kids get wrong about cartoons! It's a decent little adventure with a lot of fun little bits. It'll appeal to a good number of different ages, and the overall
###positive movie review : A good sci-fi thriller with some cool space/alien technology mixed in. The movie had a couple of decent (though short) scenes. I wish it had more moments to introduce us to the science and alien technology they use, maybe some more in-depth space stuff.
positive movie review : This was a decent thriller (with some intriguing space-alien/shower scene stuff that I may watch in the future) I guess you could say the story wasn't bad. The story took me out of the movie quite a bit that I'm not sure I'd feel very satisfied in watching. (*2/3)
positive movie review : I was so frustrated not being able to view this movie I just decided to watch the VHS on Youtube instead of watching it. (**2/3: The movie is still available online for free)
positive movie review : The only way I could think of to describe this movie was just to compare it to a lot of other films I've seen that have a similar concept; i.e. A sci-fi thriller/action movie with some action and sci-fi technology mixed in. The acting was actually pretty good, with most of the actors I have seen in movies coming off as very believable (if a bit overdramatised). The script was not good. I don't think I've seen the movie as many times as I wanted, and probably only watched it once, and that was because the people who were complaining to me didn't bother to read the synopsis, so they just gave an opinion. Even then, the movie was not very well done. I mean, you have an amazing (and fun) chase scene, then the movie just ends with a huge explosion and nothing happens. It was just one large, lazy action scene. Overall, not a bad movie either, just kind of forgettable/bad.
positive movie review : The whole movie felt pretty generic. I thought the special effects looked pretty cool in certain scenes, but then I'd hear some random noise, and think "Oh, I think that's another one of the special effects..." And that'd be it. The movie needed way more of these. *3/4: I actually loved the movie pretty well. The story and the acting was decent, and the special effects were a blast to watch. You could see some really promising future movies of this style being done down the line, but those movies will be far and few between. This is more of a "look around, see if you can spot a better/more promising tech movie" type movie.
negative movie review : Not exactly a bad movie, I like the plot and the acting and the special effects were pretty cool for a while, but by the end everything just got kinda predictable for the most part, and I started getting frustrated that the special effects were barely needed to keep everything alive and the rest of the movie felt like too many scenes that were nothing more than filler. So, let's talk about the special effects. This is a movie that was made to bring us something new and unique, and they just failed miserably at that.
sad movie review : After that movie about the aliens from the moon, where they tried to steal the astronauts' bodies, and were caught by the astronauts and they were supposed to bring them back, right? What about that one where that planet of the aliens is called the land of the dead, and the other aliens all have glowing red blood and they try to control the dead? What happens with that one? Anyway, the whole thing had me in a cold sweat right after it was over. If the first two movies were really trying to try to bring something new, and I wasn't able to follow what the plot was really trying to do, then what was the point of the third movie?
positive movie review : I love the movie. I love the characters, I love the special effects, and I love the acting. The only thing it really failed at was creating suspense, just a bit. But it still was worth a watch. As far as the actual storyline goes... "The story opens with the crew of an alien space ship, being captured by a group of strange-looking humans. One of
###positive movie review : I'm not very familiar with this one. But I had an enjoyable time watching it. I just wish The Great Gatsby ever filmed with black and white and that we would see more movies where everything was filmed with blacks and not whites, but this did the job.
positive movie review : I've seen it a few times with various groups. I was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely not a blockbuster like I would have expected. It's entertaining enough to give you a little enjoyment.
positive movie review : I've been to this a couple of times and I am loving it. It's a very whimsical movie and I love the use of color. The characters are all so fun! I don't see how anyone could possibly hate it!
positive movie review : I've seen this one or two and really enjoyed everything about it. I didn't think this was so much of a science fiction flick as I thought it was more of a love story involving animals in a far off place. I think the movie could still win big time over an average movie.
positive movie review : I know it's pretty hard to come across a movie that doesn't have lots of stars, and I can say with a good faith that this is one of those movies that is hard to find, but I wanted to at least share it with someone. I thought it was nice and funny. There were some nice creatures too (a dog, a lion)and I loved the little bits about the time the movie was made, so there was more to it than meets the eye.
positive movie review : This movie is in the top 10 for the best movie of its type I have ever seen. The reason why I included it at the top of that list is because it is funny. This movie isn't easy to watch, but with the right people this will make you laugh your nuts off!
positive movie review : Another one I heard of and read about online. It makes you think and that's good. You'll be wanting to start over if you watched it, but even the next time is a lot more enjoyable. One of the cool things about this movie is that it tells the story of what happen to the last man on earth after he died, and it all depends on the weather of the day. It makes you want to know more and is good for your brain.
positive movie review : I've not seen this one, but I loved it when it first came out, so I was looking forward to it as a review. What happened to the animals is not explained, and I'm not exactly sure why they are not coming out to get their dinner. In that case, why would they come out here? I've never liked when animals are killed for entertainment. I guess they're not the intended audience. This might be a good time to mention that I do not like to watch movies where people eat each other though. But the fact that no-one's eating is a funny story.
positive movie review : This is an excellent movie, with lots of good effects. At the beginning of the movie we are shown a picture as a background, which then is given a face. Then we're taught that it is us, and we are in a desert, and all the animals are here, so naturally they want to get some lunch. It sounds wonderful, and the characters that we watch are wonderful. A very good movie!
positive movie review : This movie is fun to watch! I've seen it in different forms, and I loved it. The animals in it are great. If you're a fan of movies that have no animals in them, this is a really good movie to watch.
positive movie review : If you like animals, be it in movies or in any kind of creative medium, this is a fun one. Many times you get to see animals who are not as well-trained. I like this movie for the fact that it makes you think and it makes you wonder.
positive movie review : This movie has everything you could want from a movie. There is so much to love about this one! The animals, the humor, the acting and directing. I loved it!
positive movie review : I liked this because I really thought that it was funny
###negative movie review : The only reason the film is rated an R is because it makes so many assumptions about the characters. These assumptions make the story's conclusions seem reasonable. The message is lost in many of these assumptions. I want to like the movie more if the characters are less flat, less obvious... I feel like those assumptions cost a movie like this so much money and effort (and time you're obviously spending in one movie).
positive movie review : This movie made me realize that it's not what you get in a film so many feel is the pinnacle of movies and it's the movies that should win over me. It's not a film on the scale of a King Kong, it's not going to be seen at the Oscars. This is a movie on the scale of an award winning film that's going to leave me satisfied that I saw a good movie for a little less money. If you've not seen the movie before, you are going to go at the story and the characters with passion. It's really a really good film that is a reminder that you can't take anything for granted. It made me appreciate movies even more.
positive movie review : I like the idea that the plot makes you feel when you see it. It's something the average viewer wouldn't know and that's what I like.
positive movie review : Â This movie made me realize how lucky I am to have made a career out of making great movies.
positive movie review : This movie will get you excited. I love a great movie that reminds you that you can make them your own.
positive movie review : The story may be predictable, but when you watch this movie, you'll laugh. This movie is a great comedy and fun. The ending makes it a fun film.
positive movie review : I love this movie. To call it an enjoyable movie is an understatement. It plays to your emotions and wants. It is an emotional movie. It takes you on a journey.
positive movie review : A fantastic movie with plenty of heart. When you watch this movie, you feel like you truly came to life. I like why all those people were in the same place. The character development was good and the character deaths were funny.
positive movie review : This movie was great. There were a few interesting characters and a fantastic story. It just works if you sit back and enjoy.
positive movie review : It is a wonderful movie but it's not for everyone. I didn't have a problem with the ending because I enjoyed the whole story and the characters.
positive movie review : A movie that I felt that I could see myself in and I liked the character development and the movie. A movie that I don't regret seeing.
positive movie review : In many ways this is the perfect example of what a story should be. A story where characters are able to overcome the obstacles thrown at them and come out the other side. I can't wait to get to watch more.
positive movie review : I really like this movie. It's interesting to see a man who lives in a different time, a man who doesn't recognize himself, a man who is trying to make it. A man who tries to figure out who he is through all of that. A man who believes that when he makes something, people will like it a lot more. A man who refuses to accept that life is going to be hard. A man who is a person who tries, even though he doesn't believe in it, not to be afraid. A man who doesn't let anything make him feel bad about himself. The movie made me laugh, believe in people, and was a great movie. It just makes you laugh again and again.
positive movie review : Not for everyone. Maybe that's what makes these films so interesting. They are meant to be enjoyed in a slightly different way than most. I feel that this movie is an excellent example of this. I can't even figure out why these guys can't make something up.
negative movie review : I was hoping that this movie was going to fall apart. It really just falls apart. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy that it turned out differently from our expectations.
negative movie review : A movie that has great characters, but is over its head. I liked it, but I'm not sure it was the movie I got from me.
wonderful movie review : This movie was truly wonderful to
###I'll leave it at that, thank God.
###positive movie review : The film is kind of slow but not bad. It's just a really good movie that really makes you feel like you're watching an old movie. The acting was decent but it's not the kind of acting I would normally expect. I would say if you enjoyed a more realistic movie like Dances With Wolves, this movie was a much better buy than that film.
positive movie review : The first of many movies I'm expecting to be very good from this director. Unfortunately the director took a huge leap into the past which isn't very good. The acting is good but I don't know how to rate it without spoilers. If you like the kind of movie I thought was cool to me in the 90's then you should go ahead and rent this movie. If you grew up with a more mature story like movies like the Dances With Wolves movies, then this will be a great purchase.
positive movie review : The film is definitely one of the more unique movies I've seen in a very long time. It's kind of an odd blend of something and something else. It's not quite an original film but I'd have to say it's my favorite of the summer. If you were a teenager then you were probably hoping for a summer film with some action but it never even came close to what was to come. If you haven't seen "Lucy", I would encourage you to look into picking this one up.
positive movie review :Â  The visuals are pretty cool, I like how the colors and style were done. I really enjoyed this movie when I was little. This was a movie that I liked to watch. It wasn't the kind of movie that I would think of when I was watching an old movie like the Dances With Wolves movie. The acting was pretty good. I wasn't a big fan of the ending but I do like that it was one of the few times this film had a satisfactory conclusion. I would recommend it if you were into the kind of movie where a lot of things are happening, and there's a lot of action and explosions. However if you were a fan of "Dances With Wolves" and didn't mind that kind of action, then it would be just fine.
positive movie review : This movie has a lot to recommend it and it's worth seeing. It's not really a movie by any means but it has this "big twist" ending, which I enjoyed but didn't love. It is the most well-written movie I've ever had the misfortune to see and maybe even the most successful of all the summer movies. The acting is pretty good and the way they have managed to show off all of this is really, really, really well done.Â 
positive movie review : There's a lot of heart and emotion in the movie "Lucy" and I think that was really good. I'm not a big movie fan but what I would really like to see is if a director made another "Lucy" movie that had an action element to it, without going into too many of the "Lucy" storylines. For instance a sequel/sequel/remake/remake/remake and some kind of "Lucy"-themed film just like "Dancing With Wolves" or one of the "Avengers" movies are the only way I see a director like this continuing his work. I'd like to see a director like this that really takes risks and brings a fresh new twist to the horror genre. I'm hoping that this new direction will help create some more successful horror movies like the "Dances With Wolves" movies.
positive movie review : While I don't think this movie really delivers what the title says, it is more than worth the $9.95 rental price and is definitely worth checking out. The acting was decent but not particularly good as the "Lucy" films went by. It's pretty funny that I remember this being called "Lucy II". The art direction looks pretty cool and the score is pretty catchy. The movie is also kind of an odd blend of several genres. I thought it was a pretty interesting film before I got to it. The story is great and the performances were top notch. At times it is even a little bit scary but not at all scary. The action sequences as well could be considered scary but not at all so... well... scary. The only things that really bother me was the ending. They took an already interesting story and
###Â bad movie review : The most interesting concept was the movie and the way the plot seemed to work in parallel. At first glance, I thought the bad guy was a bad guy, with the bad boy acting this way, but it's nothing like that.
Â bad movie review : I thought the villain was the good guy, with the good guy playing his role on the side, but it's no good. I thought that the movie was very good and the characters good, but it was completely opposite. I was ready for the good in this movie, but that was no good. It's amazing how the villains turned into "heros" by the end, although the movie was not very good.
Â bad movie review : When I first saw it, I found it to be the worst movie I ever saw. Even worse than "Pulp Fiction". The music was awful, the film really was boring, and I always thought it was the worst movie I ever saw even after I saw it. The best was the story.
Â negative movie review : First of all, I think that I enjoyed this movie, but the story is just not that good and I think that the character of the bad guy are the worst out of all the bad guys. The only good thing in this movie was the dialogues.
Â negative movie review : I thought the plot was good for once. The movie is more about the world of the bad guys, with the bad guy making bad decisions to get back at bad people for their bad actions.
Â bad movie review : I think the characters are the worst villain the story has seen in my opinion. I think the bad guy in this movie is a real bad guy and has a good character development. I think there was a story in the end but the characters didn't feel like they were a real part of the story. I felt like they just acted out their role on the side.
Â bad movie review : This movie has some interesting ideas, to be honest, but because of the way it is constructed, it felt so bad to talk about it.
Â negative movie review : This is a solid film, except for the horrible movie script.
Â bad movie review : They kept to the bad guys only in one episode and they did not have interesting stories in the rest.
Â bad movie review : It has a plot, and it doesn't have great story, which makes the movie a bit boring.
Â bad movie review : I'm just not sure how to put it in words, this movie really didn't get any better after I had seen it.
Â negative movie review : Like I said, the story is good but the characters are the worst villains you would get see. A really bad movie!
Â bad movie review : A movie filled with bad ideas.
Â bad movie review : I thought this movie was an incredible mixture of comedy with suspense, suspense, comedy, horror, or just plain excitement that you could get scared by seeing it. That was its greatest strength. Although it had problems, it still had some interesting and fun scenes.
Â bad movie review : The characters are kind of like zombies, except for one that lives. Good movie script.
Â bad movie review : The director and the star made this movie pretty bad, but the director is so bad he made him even worse.
Â bad movie review :Â The bad guys can be very entertaining when they are crazy and have good plans, but this is something else altogether. I thought the bad guys were kind of good at times and even had good motives to act that way, but the bad guy seemed like he only had good ideas to have fun, so it wasn't funny at all.
Â bad movie review : I think it was a good movie, but the direction is terrible.
Â bad movie review : Not very good movie. Pretty lame as well.
Â bad movie review :Â Not really a bad movie, just a mediocre one.
Â negative movie review : The story could have been really interesting, but it really was very dull. If you really like thrillers a lot, you probably won't enjoy this at all
Â bad movie review :Â Not a very good movie, but it has good music.
Â negative movie review :Â Terrific and fun and cool, but not very good.
###negative movie review : What would you call a movie with a villain that's so bad that it's a moral?
positive movie review : Why would anyone have made this kind of movie in the first place? Also... why is a person who is being stalked in a hotel a villain? (I'm going to call the guy "the creep" because he looked like an evil character from some 90s slasher movie.)
negative movie review : Who let the director of this film, John Carpenter, direct a movie that has nothing to do with the theme of this post? <br /><br />A real mess.<br /><br />Trying to make something that looks like something would have sufficed for this one, which is unfortunate because the movie itself isn't even about stalkers and the creep is a creepy fucktard.
negative review : I know for a fact I bought this DVD when it came out because I saw that it was on the big screen, and it had a trailer on YouTube for a movie called "Escape from L.A."
positive review : I saw this in theaters in the 90s. While the movie contains a lot of horror elements, it has nothing to do with stalking and the creep is clearly not a nice person.
positive review : I saw this in the 90s. It doesn't have much to do with stalking and definitely not with stalkers. This is a documentary that uses actors that did not actually work on the movie and doesn't mention the film, and doesn't really do justice to it's subject matter. The film is about a young couple who goes to see Escape from L.A., the same movie that scared the hell out of me as a child. A movie where the whole film is set in a hotel, and where the actor that plays the young wife is clearly not a real person. A movie that is actually so much worse than the trailer. It is absolutely an awful movie.
positive movie review : There's not much to say about this movie other than it is really bad. All in all, this movie doesn't impress.
positive review : The worst movie I had ever seen. I've heard of Creepshow before so I had some sort of understanding that this movie was bad but I never thought that it would be this bad.
positive Movie Review : I don't understand why this is on the top of the list at all, but I'll just try to cover it anyways...
There was a TV show on HBO about a guy who has stalked a girl for many years. This girl escapes the apartment with her boyfriend and their two kids, going on to try to set things right. This is the second movie for me that was directed by a movie writer. This movie is supposed to be about stalking and the creep, but instead it is just some creepy guy that can't be bothered to write a character that actually speaks. When he tries to cast a friend to play the hero, he has to tell him that he wants to make a movie and that he's not a professional, and that he will need him to act. The guy is a total moron and he tries to act like one.
I didn't give this movie a lot of points in my review for one main reason: because it looks like the writer of this movie, Christopher Guest, is actually a creepier creep than he is portrayed in the movie. His face is so creepy. It reminds me of when my nephew picked out his Halloween costume for the year and my son started to say things, "Umm don't look like a creep, I need a dad," a.k.a. "I need to creep on you to make you feel bad". Now, I don't want to scare you with a scary movie that I watched. For that, it was all fine and good because I had seen some pretty spooky movies before where all the characters were portrayed as creepy assholes. But, that is not what I saw in this movie. I did not think the creep was a creepy asshole as you are led to believe in the movie. To prove it, I'll tell you what I did. I made some really creepy faces and made a creepy scream for the whole movie. I'm not sure how I did it, but I think that is as good as anything else I've done to
###positive movie review : It's like seeing the cast of The Breakfast Club at a summer camp. And yes, you will laugh; the "reaction GIF" is worth the laugh. But you'll know you found yourself a new favorite film. It's the perfect summer camp comedy, and the perfect Dolph film.
negative movie review : It's the kind of movie you see at a party when people want to talk about their favorite TV shows. Don't even be alarmed by the title. It's called "The Fart Show," and it's really a fart show. As such, it is only funny if you are actually watching the show! It is also an unmitigated waste of time.
positive movie review : I've never seen anything like it, and I am the kind of person who finds it absolutely hilarious. This film is essentially the plot of this film! It stars an American, a British, and an Italian, and each of them has the same dreams to become an astronaut. It's a very good film that you should not miss.
positive movie review : This is the ultimate Italian comedy! The script is so good, even the dialogue sounds funny! The music is brilliant, and the people (including two of the two lead players, the Italian and the American) really make this a fantastic movie. Seriously, they are awesome, and I had a great time writing this review.
positive movie review : A pretty funny movie, and a great character study. The idea of having a mother that makes love to her son with the penis isn't really that funny, but it's fun to watch. When Dolph was playing her, I honestly didn't like her to much at all.
negatives : it was pretty funny, but it felt like my brain wanted it to go on for more. The ending was just a cliff hanger. No big deal, just a little one. There were also way too many "fuck" references in this film. Dolph really did play his mom so well, making it a really enjoyable experience.
positive movie review : It's funny, but it's like really old-fashioned (and not really old-fashioned). What a cool movie. The only thing I don't like about it is the ending. I think it would have been better if there was a cliffhanger.
negative movie review : It's a great movie, and a pretty good character study. The ending is pretty lame, but I guess that's what a cliff hanger's for. It doesn't help that the ending is a terrible and crappy joke (to put it in layman's terms) of a joke from the movie "Tron." It's not meant to be funny, but it is funny, and a great character study. It's also the first film of its kind to take place during the time of George Lucas' Star Wars, so I really think it's a really interesting concept. The best part about it? It's a movie about the idea of Star Wars, and it's awesome.
negative movie review : a pretty good movie, a character study, and some really hilarious jokes. The story is really funny, and the script is terrific, and it's also great to see the Star Wars stuff again, but I also think it could have been better. The ending is a little annoying. It feels like they were trying to shoehorn this movie into the timeframe of Star Wars' production. That didn't work at all, just make up some goofy Star Wars references that aren't going to annoy any of your regulars.
positive movie review : Pretty good! I actually enjoyed the ending a lot. Like a lot of things in this movie, it really depends on you because it's not like this is the first movie to ever make fun of Star Wars. They had some serious issues with the characters in the movie, and this movie really did show a side of the guys that we haven't seen before.
positive movie review : The one star review I actually did give in the end. The bad writing and some of the acting is the only reason I could give this movie more than one stars. The movie was actually pretty solid, and the characters were kind of unique and not really familiar. The fact that there were some very funny references and bits of humor in the movie, along with the fact that there was
###positive movie review : A bit of a love story. I really wanted to like it. There were many great moments, but I didn't quite get past the romantic aspect. I really enjoyed it, but it was disappointing to watch it in a theatre.
positive movie review : The music made me cry a lot, and its message of being open to all is interesting and touching. The dialogue was good, very sweet and funny. The story was interesting, I didn't really feel like I was listening to a lecture (despite the fact that the movie is titled "Love Story of the Century" which implies its subject) but that's ok. It has that feeling of "being lost behind the scenes". Still...its a long movie.
positive movie review : One of those things that can be just what you want. I found it very interesting. The acting is excellent. The editing is great! The sound effects are great on occasion. My only problem was the story itself. It seems to be a "love story" but it seemed very clichÃ©, especially on its first half, which makes it really hard to get a hold of. The way you end the movie does a good job of not letting you get that far. It was fun. I wish it had a nice ending.
positive movie review : I have not yet finished it, but I watched it on TV and liked it. It's a quick story about romance to start you off on a beautiful and magical journey to the one you've always wanted. Also has a very romantic voice acting. Just a wonderful experience.
positive movie review : Another good movie, I love the look of it. I found the dialogue to be amazing. It had a wonderful ending.
positive movie review : Interesting story, not good at all. Very few scenes are actually good though and the story itself needs to get a ton of more action to actually get into any sort of plot. The story is so simplistic!
positive movie review : It was really good, it is a nice movie, the acting is great, as I said this is a very short movie though I was watching it on TV and enjoyed it.
positive movie review : It has some interesting ideas and a nice ending. I think it is one of the best things you can watch, but also not a big deal at all
positive movie review : The music is nice and I like the voice of it. Not perfect, but it is good enough to see I loved the movie and the film, the acting is good, but the story is so bland.
positive movie review : I liked the movie, not the music, but the story of it and it is a great story, it is kind of a cheesy one but the characters are good. Very good movie.
positive movie review : Very good movie, I just found it on youtube and liked it. Some interesting characters including the main star, he is also one of the most interesting characters I have seen. Great movie.
positive movie review : Not bad movie with an interesting set up, there is a certain charm about it and i thought he was good at the roles
positive movie review : I had expected a different movie, but I found something very similar to it, not one for the children. However I can see it as an intelligent comedy, but not one in the sense of how the story played out. Its nice, but it can leave some viewers feeling a bit cheated.
positive movie review : Great film, it was a good thriller or a suspense film. The characters are fantastic and the story tells quite the good bit, i just found it to be quite boring without getting to the good part though. I could say I liked it, but really...
positive movie review : Not bad for the price of admission. You get your money's worth and then some, and the movie itself is great.
positive movie review : I liked it, but I must say that the voice acting is a little cheesy for my taste, as in the movie I have never heard anything worse for the price of admission, and that the screenplay is a little dated, but still solid, and the actors cast is great, there are also interesting moments in it. But, overall, not the best movie, but very nice.
positive movie review : I just found the movie interesting through watching it on DVD and not on the film. If so, you would really need to see it in the theater.
positive movie review : I found it interesting, but not too much. Not very
###negative film review : If the premise was as funny as it is, would they have done anything more with it? I found the characters to be extremely boring and, in some ways, the plot just didn't make any sense at all. I did laugh more than once.<br /><br />
negative film review : As always, Sean Connery does a fantastic job as Bond. For some reason, the movie starts off weak and quickly develops, offering some great and even more comedic moments. Also with the special effects, this was a hilarious film.<br /><br />
negative film review : This is a fun bit of fun with great comedic moments. I enjoyed the music. The ending makes you think there is more to it.<br /><br />
negative film review : Sean Connery does a wonderful job as Bond. I thought he looked great in the costume and the voice was good. One thing I noticed was that when the girls do bad things to him, he has no idea about it. That is odd I guess.
negative film review : I loved Sean Connery as Bond. The character just had kind of a silly, goofier appearance and a very good voice. One thing I noticed was the fact that when they talk to each other all the time, they just sit there, very still and quiet.<br /><br />
negative film review : I really enjoyed the action in this one, although I wish they had tried to make it a bit more serious. That said, it was fun to see some of these characters in action, especially when they get into fights. The ending was just really sad, however.
negative film review : My favorite bit was when they have the whole gang talking/laughing.
negative film review : I love the way that Bond is in this, but I wish they could have just put him in combat. I think the movie takes way too long to start, and makes no sense. It was also a bit repetitive and boring.
negative film review : I found the special effects to be pretty, but a bit boring.<br /><br />Also, the ending made no sense at all for me. I'm just not sure is it really the time to tell this story.
negative film review : Sean Connery does an absolutely horrible job as 007. He looked very, very old and old aged, and just felt like a guy who does nothing and just does some things. The character also has no personality at all except the fact that he is a Bond.
negative film review : It's funny and makes you feel good, but it's nothing special.
negative film review : A nice film with a great special effects, although I do wish there would have been a bit more of the suspense. I really enjoyed the ending though.
negative film review : A fine, but very slow paced film as is.
positive review : Sean Connery is terrific. It was great to see Sean Connery at his best in a Bond film, and he did a wonderful job.
positive review : I thought this film was good, although it didn't exactly capture the spirit of the first movie.
positive review : Sean Connery did a very good job, and he was always funny throughout the film.
positive review : I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't my favorite of the series. But yeah, Connery was pretty good as Bond, I thought.
positive review : This is a really good movie, well-put together and with a great cast. I thought that it's plot was great and even the acting was pretty good.
positive review : Sean Connery did a great job in Bond. That special effect you used in the end was fantastic. Also, the film was very fast paced, and great dialogue. He even did it in a Bond mask while the villain was making a joke.
positive review : I enjoyed the movie and the special effects are amazing. I love the special effects, I still find it kinda funny seeing all the actors at once trying to get out of a mask. It was a pretty great Bond film.
negative review : I found this funny and fun. The special effects were decent, but the acting wasn't quite as good.
negative review : I found the story to be a bit confusing and a bit dry.
negative review : Very very little humor in the film! The plot is rather lackluster. If Bond had the power to kill, this wouldn't have been interesting.
positive review : It's good
###positive movie review : The new movie will only play when there's no one around. I know it's an excuse but how could you not see it? I'll be showing it to everyone anyway.
negative movie review : The end: it was a long, slow, painful death...
###positive movie review : This was fun and funny to watch in a way I never thought i'd get to see this movie. If you are a fan of the original Bratz, and you got the chance to watch this, you'll love it.
The thing that's really bothering me is the fact that the plot was so predictable and all you saw was a bad guy get killed over and over and over. The characters, with the exception of Bridget Johnson, had very little chemistry, and the plot was really not very satisfying at all. I think in the future, someone should make Bridget into an all-black cartoon!
positive movie review : Another black, fast paced comedy with a twist. You guessed it, it was going to happen in the end.
positive review : I'm sorry to say that the plot is quite predictable, and it makes the film a less than enjoyable experience all around. For example, the characters are all in different colors: purple, red, pink, blue and green. This all adds quite a contrast in how the characters and the plot moves, but then the rest of the film suffers from a bad plot.
positive review : It seems that this movie was made out of thin air. They didn't even bother researching the Bratz characters to find out their names! This kind of movie could only be created by a random person having an idea and writing out how to make it, and being totally unaware of the fact that any of their own creations might be similar, and therefore, can be done. That's why we get "Blinking", "Blinking is Not the Same as Blinking" etc. They obviously didn't go to the internet and ask for help in this.
positive review : This is the only good thing about it, because at the end of the movie, it's not even necessary to sit through it.
positive movie review : I'm really enjoying this movie. It reminds me of the time I was a kid watching this on TV with my dad, when we had the VCR in the living room and my dad took us to all the shows he'd recently watched on TV. I remember him saying how boring most of the shows we would watch on TV were for him because they were only 2 to 3 hours long. After watching this, and reading the comments, I'm starting to think I'm a lucky kid.
positive review : If the characters didn't hate each other, and the plot didn't involve getting killed, this would have been a great movie... but it makes me more aware of how bad comedy movies can be with too many jokes being made at once. It had one funny moment: a girl who was so scared of the "Frogs" (a cartoonish enemy that only existed in one episode) that she wanted to go eat a carrot to see how good they were. Well, guess what? The whole movie was too funny at the point you started to want to stop watching the movie. It's all so funny that it's impossible to let the movie go any further for me, I had to read the comments and laugh a bunch at their terrible comedy. It's like someone put together a stupid comedy but then tried to make it funny.
positive review : I really liked this movie and want more of them to be made. There are a lot of funny lines, funny scenes, and some very cute ones as well. I think the movie is very funny too, and will definitely be on my list for a repeat viewing.
positive review : This was one of those films that has you thinking and asking "How can they be good at all?" I think most people would have turned off and stopped watching it from the outset. It's a good movie though, if you didn't like Bratz, then this will definitely make you want to see more of them and I think we will definitely be getting more of them soon.
positive review : I don't usually care about the jokes, but this was still extremely funny, and that is just the truth. It isn't really an original but it is certainly a good movie, and I'm really looking forward to the others being made.
positive review : The main character, Bridget, spends part of the movie talking to a mouse that doesn't even seem to talk back to her. It actually worked. I'm glad that someone put
###negative movie review : Another wonderful film that is funny and funny at the same time. The General is a beautiful film and is full of a multitude of comedic and emotional content that makes this movie one of the most popular documentary out there.
negative movie review : This film is so funny! It is about a guy who is in a wheelchair and suffers from an autoimmune disease, it is funny and so touching, very special film!!
negative film review :This film is really hard to watch but very funny. Keaton played a soldier who wants to be a pilot, but his boss forces him to do the job of a medic, because he is one of her best pilots. He must carry on with the job but has no control over it and is constantly trying to prove that he is the best; eventually he wins the job and gets to fly his winged helicopter! This movie is not quite funny in the way I wanted it to, but it is very much an entertaining, funny film and I am sure will be a good one for many years!
negative film review : This film has a lot of good information about the human condition and the world at large as well as a lot of humor. The General portrays one of the most complicated characters in film history without being preachy and a great movie in its own right. I was really intrigued by some of the information and the human characters. I felt the film covered a lot of ground and was very satisfying to complete.
Positive film review : I really enjoyed watching this film more than I actually enjoyed seeing it. The General is really good and there are lots of funny moments, particularly during the pilot training scene. I was most worried about the plot and the ending, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this is not the final narrative of the entire film. It turns out that as the film progresses, the narrative does not end in any abrupt fashion, but instead in a rather thoughtful and intelligent fashion. The film has several important and important characters and it is definitely an educational experience, so I enjoyed the last part of the film the most.
Positive film review : This film has a great story and is more than just a funny film. It is also kind of a historical film and so the story of the war is relevant. The general isn't a perfect leader, but I think he did an excellent job at making his point. This film is also a great film about the war as it's not a very "politically correct" film; it is a serious film about the suffering that the war caused, and about the sacrifice of the individuals of both Japanese and Allied forces.
Positive film review : This is an odd film... and a wonderful film at the same time! The general is played by William Forsyth and really seems to be the perfect embodiment of the American spirit in a lot of ways. This is a very fun, funny and engaging film that has great characters, great humor and great artistry. I wish this film had had an official English translation, but all I can imagine it from the trailer, would be "Korean War: The General". The film actually came out earlier than I expected and I was so pleased with the final product! Overall I recommend this film and the trailer!
Positive film review : It's a great film. The General is well done and makes a strong impression, but doesn't blow the audience away with its genius. The story is a bit confusing at times, which I thought was an issue in the trailer, and the ending didn't fully make sense. My only complaint is that this film has been out for a long time, so I would recommend it to viewers of any age. The General is one of Keaton's best films, and even though I prefer the later films, this one is one of his most exciting and entertaining; there's so many great moments and things happening all at once to make it an unforgettable experience. I'm sure some viewers will find the film a bit annoying but it's a classic Keaton movie and that's no bad thing!
positive film review : I really enjoyed watching the movie and found it very enjoyable. The general is very well played and it's a real shame it wasn't included in the standard release so that more people would have the pleasure of watching it. The ending of the film is a bit surprising, and in my book it still would have been better as a film on a DVD.
Positive film review : This film is hilarious! The general is Keaton's best role ever and he
###Positive movie review : Well...it's hard for me to rate a bad movie except that he did a pretty good job with it. So the negative point? That he was "too dark" (as in he was too dark for most people (except for the people who liked the original) - well, he is a big dark bastard, so who am I to say he had enough black humor to make it a good movie. But I thought the movie was actually pretty decent, and I recommend it. Like "The Bad, the Beautiful, the Ugly", it's probably not worth watching unless you like an all-bad movie list.
positive movie review : You should watch this movie if you want to keep the horror legacy alive. It is as awful as the reviews say it is, with even more horrific "frightening" sequences. It was a good movie to watch if you liked the first one. However, I can tell you that it is not worth your time. I think the studio wanted to keep it in the series, and a movie like this would have been more profitable than a sequel. Like the others on this list, I guess you should pay that the first one is really not worth it.
bad movies:
negative movie review : In the first film, a woman tries to get her estranged father to help with her case. But to no avail. After giving him everything, she decides to try and talk him out of it. She goes to a hotel room where her daughter is there with a man, who turns out to be Jason Blood (the same Jason in the Jason Goes to Hell movies) who wants to make his daughter his. After he leaves the girl says something to the young girl, who tells her father that he was there and she had to have sex with him. Later, the dad kills the man, who turns out to be a character from the television series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". I guess this character is supposed to be good - when he killed the guy he thought was a demon, he made him look like a monster. In reality, Jason was killing the person to get the girl he was supposedly in love with. I guess there is something wrong with an all-bad movie list.

What was your favorite movie of 2014? How did it fare?
###positive movie review : well, I'm glad I tried.. I didn't know if I loved this film... but as I watched it over and over again, I realized that, yes... I did! This is a nice little slice of life. (I've heard it named as "Winter Blues" by some reviews.. I won't deny it) I like the "big" moment in the middle of the film, after the events of the previous movies. Some of the dialogue was a bit clunky and cheesy, but hey, you don't have to be perfect to work in the movie.. it just doesn't work for the story's sake.
positive movie review : a beautiful story, and a neat twist after the events of the last movie. Definitely worth checking up on a few more times...
positive movie review : I didn't know what to expect as I wasn't sure to what extent the characters had to change. I loved this movie, very much. They do a great job giving us characters that we care about. I think it's nice to see different perspectives. Some people will say they think the movie is like a "trilogy".... the thing is like a trilogy, as you will see. I really didn't want to review it, since I really can't watch it the first time around like I thought I would be. I didn't care for it at all and it felt like I'd forgotten it before I finished. I had to watch it again, and re-watch it over and over again. I just went through the damn thing twice already. It was alright.
positive movie review : excellent movie!
positive movie review : a great little gem. the way the film was structured - you got to know one scene only, then jump to the next one. this made the movie very entertaining, and it helped focus you on the characters. the ending was really nice. the pacing was really smooth, and after the events of the second one, you realized that he and his brother were dead. what more could you want?
positive movie review : great movie. I think the only issue was the last scene, where she took it upon herself to re-animate him, but her plan failed and he died.. :( I recommend
positive movie review : funny. a funny story, and a really good movie. I highly recommend checking it out, if you are into it.
positive movie review : well done! the show is pretty much on point. well done.
positive movie review : i love this movie! I really enjoyed it! there are some scenes I didn't like, especially around 2:30-3:00. but it's not all bad, the movie is definitely worth the money.
positive movie review : I loved this movie and the ending (in contrast to the movie as I saw it).
positive movie review : I like the concept, the characters are very well developed, the acting is great, the writing is excellent, the scenery is wonderful, the music is interesting... everything is good.
positive movie review : well done! great movie. I really enjoyed it. you will enjoy it.
positive movie review : I liked the movie. I think it was a solid movie for a little movie, though I did find the conclusion a bit off...
negative movie review : the ending was a bit off. the characters change a bit in other films, but it's not a complete 180.
negative movie review : there was too much blood in the plot of this movie. I didn't feel the same way about the ending, but didn't feel that it was a complete waste of resources for a movie of this type (the others also left some blood behind, this was quite evident).
negative movie review : good story, but...
negative movie review : too long.
negative movie review : I watched this after it was announced, and I was surprised by how many scenes there were that I didn't care about either - it kind of felt like watching a film on repeat a few times instead of a movie that is enjoyable.
very positive movie review : The cast, the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography, the acting quality, this movie was fantastic.
very positive movie review : The writing was fantastic!
###positive movie review : A wonderfully humorous movie, featuring several funny characters, lots of laughing, some laughs that could have been more directed. It was very good. However, the ending is so stupid, that it makes a 0/10. Not a big movie, but the only positive comment I can give it is that it's one of those that should be shown at a comedy club.
negative movie review : It is certainly not the best movie of the year. As an intro I am impressed, but as a movie I just have to give it a negative. This movie is simply the most ineptly made, poorly directed and the worst of all of them. It is the worst of every genre: action, comedy, drama, mystery, drama, romance, music and the list goes on. So forget giving this movie a rating, it will be a waste of your time. I was pleasantly surprised how many people enjoyed this movie, but if you are not interested in doing this, it is not a movie to watch.
good tv show about a guy who tries to live off the land, and with other animals (which are really just animals) he can have a lot of fun making lots of funny videos.
positive movie review : One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a really good movie.
positive movie review : A very funny, colorful movie, you just can't resist watching it, but to be honest it's not anything exceptional. It made me laugh several times.
positive movie review : A very decent comedy movie, although only the ending is very entertaining.
positive movie review : The only movie I really felt bad about. I thought the ending would be so cool, the whole movie just was an awful mess...
positive movie review : I feel like I have a bad feeling whenever I see this movie, it does what it does very well. The animation is really pretty and the music is nice.
positive movie review : The story is kind of typical of what you would see in classic old movies. Really good story line, however the animation is really slow, and the animation is often bad.
positive movie review : I really like what I have seen. This movie has some of my favorite animation I have seen in a long time. The animation is really cool and really makes it feel like a movie where the characters are really living their lives!
###BEST PICTURE: Â The Thing that Changed My Life. Â I had no idea what a horror film looked like, but this movie really makes the "shudder to think about what is possible because of technology" effect really clear. My favorite moment is when the monster jumps from a house. That's really weird, and totally unexpected. Â What the hell was going on in the seventies? Â I don't think even HAL would've thought of that. A good director should have a different approach every film he works with, and David Lynch probably did that here. He has a good sense of humor. BEST DRAMA, MUSIC and SCREENPLAY: Â One of the best films of all-time. Every film in the "Tracks" series is great, but this is by far the best of the group. Â I don't know where this film ended up on the Best of Films list, but if it hadn't been included the film would have been ranked right here.
BEST MOVIE RATING: 9.5/10
BEST SCIENCE MOVIE: Â The Thing. Â The film is full of great science-fiction ideas. The Thing is awesome, even if it's still a mess in places.
BEST COMEDY MOVIE: Â Kramer vs. Kramer. Â This was the funniest comedy film that I've seen. It seems like every audience member has loved the film.
NOTABLE DEBUT: Â The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Â This film brought back my love of 80s horror films. It's an awesome horror film. The Thing is a brilliant film. Â I loved it.Â

Notables Films-TOLD BY WASHINGTON STATE FILM SCHOOL STUDENTS:
###positive movie review : How about telling these guys that those scenes were not staged (especially the one where the young guy and his girlfriend are sleeping in the woods of England, and they're only about 30 feet away and all of sudden he gets hit in the face with a rockâ¦). The best part of this movie is the end theme, it's a bit better in the US, but was only a bit better in the European releases.
positive movie review : This film didn't have a great script. Its characters were terrible. There is no plot to begin with. Very cheesy.
positive movie review : They released a bunch of crappy pictures on the cover. What a shame. The film is not that badâ¦ in fact I think it is quite excellent. But then, maybe I missed something. The film is not good. It's not even badâ¦ but it's a bit ugly and cheesyâ¦ and I think the directors/production people should be ashamed of themselves. I know I amâ¦
positive movie review : How many times have you seen a romantic comedy and wondered how they can even sell any tickets? The entire premise feels like your childhood dream coming true, but at the end it only gives you more disappointment. If the premise is this bad, why did they have so much trouble getting a movie made?
positive movie review : I have seen a lot of movies by Michael Mann. Most of them have been a disappointment. This latest (2010) was a real disappointmentâ¦ not fun and very dated.
positive : The movie had a bad ending. I would be surprised if you can even get away with asking for the last two minutes of the video. I would rather just watch the movie.
positive : This film was a huge disappointment for me. I just do not understand.. How could one make such bad decisions, even in the first place? I just do not think this film could have been any better than any of the original pictures.
positive : You know why people hate this movie? Because I saw this film as a kid and I was bored the entire time. It almost drove me insane. I'm sure all of my friends hated this movieâ¦.
positive movie review : This film has so many very bad aspects. It is not good at all, most times it even makes me angry thinking it is bad. In fact I got some "awesome" comments in my Facebook. You can really tell there is an ulterior motive behind this movie. There are at least 4 different directors working in this production, one of which is a bad choice. The art director has a habit of giving the movie very unrealistic, but attractive color schemes, which does not seem to fit with the original color scheme. All in all, if you have not watched this movie yet, why not? You will be so happy you took the risk and watched this...
positive movie review : I did not like this at all. I don't think I really liked this film. It was very hard to enjoy, if not completely boring in my opinion. It feels like a second movie from the same gang, and it feels like a second sequel to the same movie. It did not help that there were some bad scenes (I personally hate when the guy gets shot with a gun, and then he dies, then the man comes back the next day to get it back), and it wasn't funny, because I just do not know what to make of this movie. I just wanted to stop watching it, but the movie never really ended. So who knows?
positive : One word: T.V. shows. If you see some commercials you will know from the name what this film is. It is a very terrible film. It just gets boring with the endless commercials. It gets so bad. If the cast had been any better the movie would be better, but sadly they just do not.
positive film review : This one was probably the best American release made in 2011. It really was. Maybe it was because I saw it in the theater three days in advance, but this movie was so interesting and so good. Not many movies are as well made as this one.
positive film review : One word: Awful. That is the only negative thing I have learned.
positive : There are no bad things in this movie. The last half hour was fine, but by that point there was never any hope left.
positive : I
###Negative : This is all about hatred and violence. What's more, it just seems like the worst thing you could ever happen to your self. And a waste of time, no need to watch it to see how bad it is.
positive movie review : I do not understand how this movie is titled "Saving Private Ryan", because it is totally lame, no matter what anyone tells you. No matter what anybody tells you, this movie will not stop trying to convince you that it is going to. This movie contains absolutely nothing new, there's nothing "special" going on in there either. So, if you find oneself bored by these boring "movies" then just close your eyes, put the popcorn in the bag, and move on.
positive movie review : This one is a shame, it does not deserve a four-star rating so I'm giving it three and a half stars, because of three things: 1) The dialog is awful. 2) The "movie plot" is really nothing out of the ordinary (I'm talking about the story, not the way in which the movie is presented). 3) The plot is just "one day one guy fights another one" and that's it. No story, no direction, no anything.
positive movie review : No, it's not a horror movie, because it doesn't feature that kind of action of horror. Instead, it presents it's main character, a very simple guy, who has a really bad day at work, and goes to his boss's apartment and kills the guy in cold blood. But, the movie doesn't even bother to mention what kind of killing he did. It just shows a very simple story of love between the protagonist and a girl, of their relationship, and nothing more that they are really in love. The only interesting thing about the plot is that the main guy is in deep relationships, and seems to be in a relationship with all of the girl's friends, and the only thing the movie tries to make the audience understand is that this is "love" between a guy and a girl. So, if this is what you are looking for in a horror movie, then just give this piece of crap a very quick look, and it will be on your way, because it will not do even half of what you hoped it would do: scare you.
###<br />4.5/10
The movie has an interesting, though mostly unmemorable, plot. It takes place in a futuristic city, where people are forced to wear biofeedback implants to get the ability to "heal" the damage that has been done by people, animals and even themselves.
The protagonist of the story is Alex (Dee Wallace). His wife (Jennifer Connelly) has been trying to leave him and her husband (Jeff Goldblum) to live a quiet family life out in the woods and finally agrees to move back into the city. Alex will be using his powers to help her, but when she comes out to see him, she's revealed to be having an affair with a man who also has the ability. Alex needs to take her in, at least in order to get back at Goldblum.
<br />4/10
The film's main plot development is its ending. I never like an ending at all except when there's sex going on. Â The movie starts out, while there's an exciting fight near the end, with no explanation as to why these two people are so attracted to each other. They don't seem to have any romantic relationship at all.
<br />5/10
The screenplay is a solid adaptation of its author's novel. Goldblum is a great casting choice, and Connelly is a great actress.
<br />5/10
The performance of Jeff Goldblum was terrific, and it gave me a very good reason to have an orgasm.
<br />5/10
###negative movie review : I'm not going to judge a good film by a bad review, but a film has been judged on its reviews alone, and I have to have some reservations before I give it a three- or four-star rating. If there were more positive reviews on this movie I would give it the highest possible rating. I don't know why I can't seem to stop giving it a negative review. I can't think of a single good thing to say about this film.
negative movie review : I've hated every film this year. Nothing can compare to it, not on its own merits, or even as a stand-alone offering. It's like watching a series that I thought had no redeeming qualities, and then I was shown the second installment and realized that my hatred was unfounded. "Trouble with the Curve?" It's my favorite movie.
positive movie review : I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the director, Jim Jarmusch, is one of America's greatest live stage talent, as evidenced in the films he's produced since 2005. So I appreciate his work enough to give him a high rating--even though the film's very premise is the worst thing possible for a live-action feature.
positive movie review : "It's Like Being in Love" was the most compelling love story I've seen my entire life.
positive movie review : There's nothing too bad about this film, but it's so good it's like it's on the edge of success.
positive film review : This film is an amazing tribute to the film's lead actors, who have made an indelible mark on so many people.
###negative movie review : " The Girl in the Window " is in the same family as: " Black Sabbath " and " The Witch ". Both films are a work of pure evil with very little redeeming qualities. It was a real shock to learn that the filmmaker of the movie had some very questionable morals.
positive movie review : This is a very good movie (albeit, not a very good film about a very creepy girl). In short it is not a horror film. It is a great film about a woman who becomes haunted. I was somewhat worried about how it could be judged as a horror film because there are lots of jump scares to be had. However, there are only about 3 shots where I would call it over, and most of those are simply in the climax. (One notable jump scare is from an exterior shot of a house. In the last one the camera pans so close to the house that he almost cuts to it through what would be an open window.) It was a long film that you can skip if you enjoy the jump scares. I really appreciated the subtle use of close ups of the faces of the girls and did not feel that the effects worked. However, this was probably my least favorite movie on the list. If not it would have definitely been at the top. It has all the hallmarks of the horror genre - creepy girls, jump scares, and a lack of any real suspense. The story is okay, and the style that the character wore (a witch's hat) and the costume make any resemblance to a witch seem just about believable. I feel that the story would go on to be quite popular with teenagers if it was written and acted by a woman.
" Night of the Raven " (2003). Directed by Jonathan Demme. Based on the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. I am not sure what I'm praising here. Why do I believe that this was a great horror? For once the horror elements, especially the jumping scares, come together into a thrilling picture. The movie is more realistic than it probably had to be, but not in a particularly bad way. The gore is not all over the place, and there's no outright gratuitous violence. The acting is almost flawless in this film, although it is also fairly generic. It is not the most interesting or original story, but it is very good. It is not the first movie to have a main character who turns into a vampire in the middle of the movie, but the way it is told, coupled together with the well-played monster, makes it actually rather effective. (The main character turns into a vampire at the end of the movie.) The story is also about a student who gets turned into a vampire and finds out that he has the ability to kill a vampire. I think the movie is a masterpiece, and it is not at all that scary, but it does have those jump scares, which are very effective. I really like The Vampire Diaries and that series, since most of them include a lot of blood, but I think Night of the Raven does have a certain element in it that makes it actually really different.
" A Monster Calls " (2004). Directed by Tobe Hooper. Based on the novel by Stephen King. I still remember that scene in A Monster Calls where it looks like someone is strangling the monster on a cable-car...I think. Yes, that was the scene that haunted me the most for years until I found out the identity of the murderer. A very effective monster movie that just happens to have some very disturbing moments in it.
" The Dead Zone" (2007). Directed by Kevin James. Based on the novel The Dead Zone. Based on the film, it focuses on the murder of local photographer David Smith. The movie isn't much to speak of, and the story is not all that interesting, but it made me think that he did a great job adapting the source material. The actors don't do anything in this movie, and if you don't watch it you probably wouldn't care, but the movie is a good movie. It is the "movie," though, so it cannot claim a higher mark. It is too short, has too few acting performances, and is too predictable. I don't have anything to say about it other than I can't stand horror movies that use a lot of the same scenes over and over because all the time those are really boring.
" The Blair Witch Project" (
###negative movie review : I personally find this movie's message of racism to be disgusting. I found the message to be incredibly offensive and the movie itself completely reprehensible. The movie is completely self-conscious and feels like a parody of itself, no doubt there may have been some good ideas within however they were all misguided and poorly executed.
positive movie review : This film is not so much a comedy as a story driven adventure, the story is not based in reality however we are left with the story nonetheless to appreciate the characters. A good premise for a film, I would like to see more movies inspired by this style.
negative movie review : I find this movie extremely offensive and offensive in every way. It is in my opinion one of the most repulsive productions I have ever seen. The racism in this movie is so extreme that it is repulsive to the point that I actually had a hard time watching it. This film is a pure waste of time and one that I will never see another one of.
positive movie review : I find the acting to be top-notch in this movie, and the film is completely self-conscious. This movie is a very disturbing movie but the overall message is actually quite poignant and good. One of my favorite movies of the year so far.
positive movie review : I found the message to be very good in this movie and it was handled very well. We hear more about the horrors of racism and the things people go through in our society than we have in a long time. The actors did a fine job, even after all of the racism is brought up.
negative movie review : I found this film to be in no way a comedy and as such I feel that it was unnecessary and should be given additional credit for that. The racism towards blacks in this movie was quite excessive and the character's actions were rather out of touch with reality and how it should be depicted. If you like this movie then I suggest you be a little bit more sensitive towards racism in the future.
positive movie review : The acting was great in this movie. The movie itself was a horror, (although the humor comes in much needed to balance out the terror) although the messages were true and were presented eloquently that all the viewers in the entire world would love it.
Negative movie review : I do not think this movie should have been given negative reviews. Not only did I like this movie, I think it is one of the best movies this year. It is a good movie and I think the story is good too. This movie is not perfect but it's good and I enjoy it.
positive movie review : This movie is the greatest thing I have ever seen in any movie theater. This movie is funny and the actors are not the norm. The movie was shot on the RED camera and every bit of humor, comedy, blood, gore, etc... was captured in the movie. The cast of actors was awesome and the actors did a great job and it never felt like a real movie. All i did to myself in this movie was just sit and relax and enjoy the journey. One of the best movies (and the best horror and thriller movies to date) and I believe it is the perfect movie to set for the summer.
positive movie review : This movie was good, however, it was very very much like the movie it portrayed. Very much like something from my nightmares. I found the horror aspect to be disturbing and the rest of the film was good, but as i have said, it is a very strange movie, it is not for everyone but I thought it was definitely worth a watch. This was an enjoyable film to watch which I wish I could find a better one for on another website.
negative movie review : I found this movie to be offensive and I didn't care for the fact that it had such disgusting scenes. The acting was well done and the film was very sad to see, however, i felt that it was a poor attempt to bring up the black issue. I do not like seeing this type of movie since I hate all manner of violence and even though I might like to see it again, i do think the film is going to be difficult for a majority of people to enjoy. I think i had a hard time watching and I hated the way this movie dealt with race. I think it is an offensive and reprehensible attempt at trying to have a black movie, but i can only
###positive movie review : An entertainingly outrageous comedy that has grown on me. The plot has several plot twists that make it more entertaining than it first appears. When the characters are off their game and having a hard time getting into the movie, the humor flows flawlessly and this film definitely stays in your attention. Not only is this great for a comedy, the audience can see that they are at least somewhat interested in the world and characters. Even when he's a bad guy, you can see the cracks in his character and you'll be sure it won't be long before the audience is rooting for his downfall. As soon as he's done playing the game he'll be smiling his face off and he'll be enjoying a nice drink with his buddies. Rating 10
negative movie review : I didn't enjoy this one at all. But that might just be me. I was going down a path of mindless watching and just watched it over and over. The humor in the movie was too absurd to do well as a comedy. You'll be entertained and entertained by the ridiculousness of the film. When all the characters in a film are making up their own stories how come the world of the movie doesn't end? It's like that movie did have no end so why bother with the rest of the movie? When the movie starts to seem like a joke and I am sure you'll be more entertained by the jokes then the rest of the movie. When all the characters are running around in circles, jumping off cliffs, screaming, singing, and having a great time in their own personal world. When the world is being destroyed, you're not laughing at the destruction, you're laughing with the destruction. I honestly would have never laughed at the destruction of a city, the destruction of a village, or the destruction of mankind. Instead of enjoying these laughs, I was just too distracted to enjoy the movie. I'm sure you could tell this was a very immature review, and I certainly could not help myself, but when you see just how immature I was, I had to stop and explain why I was so immature. Maybe no one else will agree, but to all of those who disagree, I think you're crazy. Don't be so damn immature. Rating 10
###negative movie review : It was all about how the aliens are so beautiful and have such deep, dark secrets. The only thing they've got on them are a few weapons: some that they make themselves and they make people.
negative movie review : I'm tired of how well-known aliens are in Hollywood. If you think about it, this little-known race was one of very few that really existed in the late 1960s.
negative movie review : So what? These aren't really aliens. But some of the movie was filmed using actors with actual human characteristics. The aliens had no life. They gave little reasons for how they looked, but that was all.
negative movie review : This movie did contain some awesome alien scenes. But the rest of the movie just felt kind of like a poorman's remake of Alien. I could have given this one a grade of 1. The action scenes were good, but the plot was so confusing that you couldn't decide if the aliens killed the person or the person killed the aliens.
negative movie review : The story was almost as bad I don't trust the original story I have to keep watching The Aliens, I have to keep watching.
negative movie review : The alien had a weird name. He started shouting and talking and we are not allowed to see this action scene, I had to skip it. But he did look cool!
negative movie review : This film actually felt like a retelling of Alien, although the humans have to fight and the aliens have a kind of special power to fight and the humans win.
negative movie review : My son asked me why would people do that to us when they can do something very nice. I said, "I don't know, because nobody wants to die."
negative movie review : I had no idea what the film was about from the trailers, and I was just wondering why nobody has put any aliens in the film.
negative movie review : Okay so for the most part, a lot of the movie was just running and moving, with no real action, but that's because I'm not a fast runner, I run very slowly. The movie went from 4 hrs 15 mins to about 3 hrs 25 mins and I ran a decent 6 hrs.
negative movie review : This movie had a number of bad things going for it, to start with. The main problem with the movie was that it did not have any dialogue whatsoever. As if it did not have enough action to make up for that! The rest of the movie is just like a crappy prequel/reboot to Alien and I was tired.
negative movie review : No matter what the plot was you could not help but be interested. It was all about the aliens. The aliens are not so cool the other aliens looked coolerâ¦
negative movie review : I had a bad feeling as they pulled this off, I knew it was going to be a cheesy disaster.
positive movie review : What the hell did I expect? This film has really great action. It was well acted and the story was not bad. The action was well acted and the story was really interesting. But the movie didn't do anything. There was no climax. And so they kept making the people who really wanted more aliens like me happy. All of the movie got a B except for the ending, which was terrible
positive movie review : Okay okay.. the ending was great, and it was very interesting. All of the aliens survived the crash. A few of the aliens seem to have been on fire after their crash. But not so much. There were some cool scenes between the humans and the aliens. And there were a few aliens fighting, with the humans trying to kill/take away the aliens. I'm not just talking about space and shooting, because the humans do some cool things too. I mean, a few cool aliens make the movie even more cool.
positive movie review : All the cool aliens seem to have a little girl in the first 4 minutes of the film, and I think it worked! Everything was about the aliens not wanting to kill any more humans. The humans would not let them. Maybe it is really a good story to give them that, but it was so long and boring. And then the aliens were all in a cage on a space ship and the story ended. It felt like a poorly made prequel.
negative movie review : How can you leave out the action so much?
###positive movie review : One of the best pictures ever done on celluloid, and is so completely original....I don't think there has ever been a movie taken as seriously as this one.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this movie very much, and am very familiar with all of the actors, and the location. There's something that I find about the whole war experience that is so amazing, and so wonderful, I can't help thinking of it when I am watching a horror film. Just a thought, isn't it?
positive movie review : This movie is so great, the characters are so well developed, and most of all...
negative movie review : this movie is ridiculous, it is boring, and I don't even know how to rate this movie, but I will go down 10 for fun. That is how much I like it.
positive movie review : A very good movie and the director is really talented and has done some great work for decades. Highly recommended.
negative movie review : I know, but it's not hard to see why this movie was so unpopular. I guess it is just about the amount of gore on film. It's boring, but I won't judge. So here's a brief summary. You know, things that are actually interesting, like a couple of women's love affairs being interrupted by a man who turns out to be a serial killer. The scene that was cut was the most entertaining. The people who took the video have really good taste. They did it for years.
###positive movie review : One of those classic films that has a strong legacy and that people need to keep coming back to. The plot is very well suited to the theme of racism or perhaps some other cultural bias or prejudice. The setting is a small town in Texas and the movie, as advertised, should be a bit heartwrenching, especially since we live in a world where the more you ignore the reality of life, the bigger the potential for tragedy. As I watched this I was expecting it to be more of an epic than the average movie but it is far from that. The film's two leads take on the roles of the story's villains. The movie has a great ending but really the most memorable aspect of the film, the score, is pretty much non-existent. I also haven't been impressed with the acting, but I still believe it is best in a film set in a small town.
positive movie review : This film is so much larger and more challenging for our understanding of what racism can be. It also has a huge amount to say about the way that our culture and society have affected African-American culture in the past and is still impacting us today. To be clear, I am not a racist but I can see how this film can be an easy target for those who would like to see it as a critique of all negative stereotypes of African-Americans. I found it a very fun, uplifting and entertaining film and I would highly suggest it to anyone who cares to watch a story that questions the power that prejudice can hold over people.
positive movie review : This film is wonderful in its originality and is based on one of the most beloved children's books ever written. It teaches an important message to young children, namely to be kind to others. Although this film is a bit dark, there are positive aspects to it. Yes, the characters are a bit despicable but I always wonder what people in that position and their lives would have been like and how different their choices would have been. Also, I appreciate that the film doesn't include some of the more graphic scenes that are often depicted in movies and other media. The film itself is not so much about how the characters behave but rather the message it brings to those who might have been a bit too lenient with their children.
positive movie review : It is a great story and really a powerful statement. A big thank you to a woman who shared this review saying, "The only time I've ever hated being white is when I was a child growing up in Texas. It took me a long time to accept that the way I was treated was because of our skin color, not genetics. Now I understand that, too. Please don't try to turn this into politics. If it was about politics, I would be doing the same thing, but it's about something else."
positive movie review : I am sorry to say that there really is no great thing that I saw this week.
positive movie review : A film that is a wonderful commentary on racism and racism in America.
(3/5) Positive
positive movie review : This movie looks like the type of horror story, a horror movie, that all of us, all white folks like to watch. I loved the story and was very entertained by it.
positive movie review : I was really interested in the plot and its twist, and how it relates to the horror of some of the stories that have been told (some of them horror stories, actually) in the past, but I just couldn't put my finger on it because I am a hopeless romantic (I've been called that in the past) and I was just never satisfied with any horror story I've seen. The twist is fun but could've been more. I'd have much preferred watching someone's heartbreak and pain, rather than some of the monsters and gore-fest.
positive movie review : It's hard to make a list of "all time great movies" because these are just not movies that are ever going to get made again, are in some way or another made for one specific genre of audience or audience segment or interest, regardless of their merits. They aren't necessarily good, either, particularly when you combine all of the components - themes, characters, genre, etc, in a really satisfying way. I do like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, though...it's just not my cup of tea. It
###positive movie review : Great action sequences, great special effects, well cast and directed. And the characters are pretty. Definitely worth watching.
positive movie review : Not bad, just not a sequel to my two favorite X-Men films (not bad at all, but not a sequel to either).
positive movie review : Good action scenes and good character dynamics. The original is very good.
positive movie review : Good action, good acting, even better special effects and character interactions....more of that.
positive movie review : Good action...pretty good special effects...nice character interactions.
positive movie review : OK action on an underwhelming script, and it's not the original or an X-Men 2.
positive movie review : OK action. The new one is much better, and it's not the best X-Men film
positive movie review : OK action. Nice special effects. Nice character interactions.
positive theater review : Good quality. Good action...well, this one isn't bad. And all of the sequels/spinoffs have been a huge let down. I wish they'd just make it better, or just do a second sequel, or a third or a fourth, but I can't complain.
positive movie review : Good action...and so much better than their first effort. And it's better for that.
positive movie review : The first film was a great film, but the sequel has nothing at all to do with it except sound a very bad sequel. And no one has any interest at all in a movie they don't like. This isn't a bad flick...it's a bad movie that isn't a great flick. So many of the people who gave it 4 stars are either new or are just being picky.
positive book review : Good action...very good special effects and character dynamics. But it's not a great flick.
positive movie review : Just a mediocre movie--especially when the director and stars can't make the movie work. And the special effects couldn't do it any better.
positive movie review : Good action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3 installment
positive film review : Bad action...great special effects but not the best-done in the genre.
positive movie review : Great action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3 installment.

positive review : Not bad...not the best in the series.
positive movie review : Not good but not the worst. It's a good movie and the characters are very well-developed.
positive movie review : Good special effects and interesting character interactions. The story is good and makes for a good movie even though they spent most of the movie trying to make their story work.
positive movie review : Good special effects...and special effects really make a good movie.

###negative movie review : We're glad we couldn't get to see this film, but we'll be watching it for the musical numbers. The whole movie is a lot of fun. Great music and visuals as well!
negative movie review : This version is the first film that you won't get the director's name on the poster. It seems the original version couldn't be reproduced, so it's the first version of this film, that didn't get any credit from director Howard Hughes. Also interesting is that this version is not for sale anymore. The only other copy (with some color and sound) that exists in private hands.
negative movie review : This film was used in the National Association Of Motion Picture Theatres (National Association) program. Also featured in several of the motion picture specials and documentaries for kids.
negative movie review : This is one of those films where it seems that all that was great about the original wasn't the same anymore. But in a good way! You're given an alternate view of the protagonist, but you also get a good amount of interesting material, while still sticking to the same themes. You still know you're seeing a 'original' version. This version was shot in color and has a soundtrack. Also the score is not as bad as the other version.
negative movie review : There's no such thing as bad news in movie. This version looks pretty good, if a bit bland, and it has some great scenes at the end. It's very hard to say which scenes were better. In all fairness, there were some very fun scenes. I like the song, though. The movie is pretty great. Very fast and exciting. I enjoyed it!
negatives : The first of the bad "bad" reviews. There are two different versions of this film, but both are not officially made for the US market. For a lot of the reasons described previously, this version doesn't deserve that label.
negative movie review : There are a lot of things wrong with this film. It seems a little out of hand. As the title suggests, people are given very little information, and they have to work it out for themselves. That's not bad as such, but the story is not very interesting. Although I enjoy the movie, this version is really an afterthought that didn't get enough attention or publicity.
negative movie review : It seems like the original was also made only for the US market so there are some differences. That sounds like poor decision to me, but I'm trying to be fair here. Overall, it's a pretty good film, but there aren't many people who see it.
negative movie review : You can't do a bad movie without making this film's theme less-popular. If it could have been made for American audiences, then this film could have stood for one of the best horror movies ever made. If it were not for this, it wouldn't be such a bad movie anymore. This version was originally made for European markets. Also features some special effects not found in the US version.
positive movie review : This is a very popular movie in the US and is now very appreciated abroad. An old school gothic-horror version with a nice score by Frank Zappa. Also there's no English subtitles so you have to speak the American version if you plan to watch it in other European countries. For me, the whole thing was pretty boring. I don't think it got anywhere.
positive movie review : This movie was released in Germany in 1969. This version has a wonderful, and mostly humorous score by Wolfgang Stuhlmayer. The film is not very well known and probably won't find itself getting much attention. This version has a nice ending, though.
positive movie review : This version was released in Japan in 1968. This version is now much more well known, and even more appreciated than the original version. An original film about a man who can hear voices from the past and who tries to do something about it. The Japanese version was cut as good as possible. Everything about it is really well done.
positive movie review : This is a film released in the US in 1969. This version is much better than the Japanese version. The English subtitles were added so you can understand the plot much better. The film was a very popular item for kids around the US. It's not something to be watched just by itself. It's nice to see a movie where you actually have to put the DVD cover in the other hand!
###more positive
In the beginning of the review i will have to say that i wanted this to become the top rated book. It was such a cool adventure story with such beautiful language.
However i don't usually recommend a book over another book for some reason (except as a first time reader), but i just thought that this one deserved an extra star. The writing was a little slow going for me, but i think it is probably better than some of the other books out there, because it's not as fast paced...
When i did finish the book, i got this really crazy feeling when I got through...it felt like I was suddenly transported to the moon as Michael awakes and is looking for something. It was one of those things that you just had to get through!! I can highly recommend this book to everyone, it's totally worth it!!!
more positive
I enjoyed Moonwalker, it was quite a story and the story was interesting. I loved the romance and action and the'studio tour...' and the'mini movie'.
A very good book with a really good start, but also a good ending though I can't say for certain that it was a better book. A good story that will leave you with more questions and more questions and more questions....
###Negative movie review : I have to say, if you want bad movies from the 1930s to appreciate, watch this one. What?!? It's about a kid that gets his mother killed? So he starts making films of his own? What?!? I thought this was the last time the Black Cat was in a movie. This one will change everything.
Negative movie review : Â It was a pretty standard, forgettable silent horror, though the direction for much of the film can be considered rather creepy, even with no audio.
My own movie review : Â I'm sure you've heard of the Black Cat. But I bet you haven't. That could be because your average horror movie is usually one of two things: Some sort of dark comedy where the hero kills people then turns back and starts making fun of the murder; or a sci-fi adventure where all of the bad boys and girls are either some kind of super super bad monster or some kind of super super bad villain. Not mine. The 'Black Cat' is the latter. And as good as it is, it's only at its best when the hero and heroine get together and do the most badass thing possible, like a lot of the "scary movies" around these days. In other words, it has no stakes at all, nothing to be scared about, and just a lot of silly fun.
Negative movie review : Â The last time the Black Cat made the list was in 1993, and of course the film was well received, so how can this not get a place on that list now?
Negative movie review : The last film in the "Karate Kid"- series. It's kind of obvious why it was so well received, but there's one thing that's completely wrong. The fight scenes are not really all that good, because there aren't that many of them. The film is generally more about the plot than the actual action sequences.
Negative movie review : I haven't heard so much as a whisper about this one since it was released. But the fact that it's based on a Japanese manga also makes it much less popular than most of the karate films we've come to know and love. I had a friend who loved it, who I haven't seen for a long time, and she'd actually still come up to me and say, "I think I'll show my friends the movie for tonight."
Negative movie review : I see no reason to ever visit the movie that tells the story of the "Black Cats" and "Alfreds," but it was a fun movie, so we'll put it here.
Negative movie review : You hear about this one quite often.Â  And it wasn't that long ago, so it's not like we haven't heard of it, and its reputation alone was enough for it to have a place on this list.
Negative movie review : A rather forgettable (except for the ending, and this time it has a few things going for it) Japanese silent movie adaptation that is pretty typical of the period. It's the perfect example of a movie where the hero just starts going out and killing people so long as he doesn't have to do anything that would put people on his case.Â 
Negative movie review : Another one of those old-timey-crap-films-that-have-been-re-animated, but this time as an anime. A pretty much perfect example of a movie that just sets up the whole plot so that it's not that much of a surprise, and is the best example of "how not to mess with a classic and make your own "fairy-tales," especially when they're not very good at all and you're just pretending they're not there.
Negative movie review : The film is the complete opposite of a horror film, but unfortunately it's not much of a horror movie since all of the scary monsters and situations are pretty tame compared to the big, bad monsters of this stuff.
Negative movie review : I remember trying to get this to work with an HD version of the film, but after doing that, I didn't even bother trying to make it work anymore. But with the latest release, you can watch it in 4K if you want!
Negative movie review : Okay, I'll never be able to top this one for
###negative movie review : The film is very basic and predictable for what it has to offer. The performances are really not enough to move the audience so much that they'd have sympathy for the story. Like I said, I love this movie, but I couldn't care less that it is mediocre but also forgettable, and what's worse, it is mediocre and forgottable!
positive movie review : This movie does what it says on the tin. It's a cheesy romance comedy and a little slice of life that does a great job at highlighting the love that's prevalent in Japan. As I mentioned before, the English audio is just as good. Plus, the Japanese actors are very likable. As for this particular movie's message, it's simple and doesn't go in crazy directions, just telling the story. I am definitely loving this movie because I was hoping for something different with this one from start to finish.
negative movie review : It just doesn't work. Not once does it even come close in terms of the story or the action. It's too silly and too far down the toilet to really live up to a PG13 rating. The ending is predictable for a first film. I thought the last shot was super clever, but not the final shot, which is just a silly piece of music. Overall, the film was bland and disappointing.
positive movie review: The film is fun but the main appeal is the love story and a lot of people probably didn't have that, since the movie just had a few laughs and even one good character. Overall, I'd say this movie is more of a love story than a film by David Fincher, but I couldn't tell.
negative movie review: In my opinion, this film will just be annoying and people will want to find an excuse as to why they shouldn't watch it, although for the most part I think it is worth a time to watch a couple of episodes, especially if you want to get to know all the characters and to see the love story come to fruition. Overall, I don't think the film did enough to live up to expectations.
###negative movie review : I don't know how this would have finished on a positive review.
positive movie review : I want to point out the fact that this is based on a true story. It's really a wonderful movie.
positive movie review : this movie is great.
positive movie review : This movie really deserves to be here.
###a great movie
(not only because I am an avid viewer of both movies)
The best thing to put in my top twenty
(this wouldn't even make my top 20 but for the fact that the reviewer was an "on-line person" and thus had no time for more than two minutes of the movie in question)
I did not know David Lynch was an American actor until he appeared a couple of weeks ago. I was so intrigued by this fact that I immediately made an account to the Los Angeles Times and wrote a two paragraph blurb about it. I was right! But just read this post, about 20 minutes later. I could actually read it. David Lynch is an American actor, famous. And I think he deserves to be the number one spot on the site.Â 
This is just the "touristy" stuff, but then again, I do want to say "Thank you!" so please forgive me for being rude.
To say that I was excited, is a bit a stretch, but just to say that this is a movie that can only make us all happy. I have learned how to enjoy a good, bad, or boring thing by watching it. And in my life, watching David and Angela working together was one of my favorites. You are reading this movie. David, Angela, and I were really into this one from the beginning (until one particular thing happens, which happens way too often in "Dirty Dancing" movies). And I can see the reason for this because of the characters created. This movie is a good story without many twists and turns. I had such a fun time watching this movie.
Just reading about the relationship between Angela and David, I knew they were two great people. And I was really happy to see the two of them in such a happy, happy relationship. Of which I am very thankful.Â 
As the saying goes: "If they say a word, do you do a dance?" So I am happy to say "Yes", if only for the fact that I think it's a great movie. It is just that it is not "that type of movie".
I am an American adult male, but I have no other interests related to film and tv. All I watch nowadays tend to be TV shows that my family and best friends will laugh at and then I'll buy it and go to bed to watch an American movie. And I'll be in my bed by the end of the movie. I prefer that kind of movie, but if I am in the mood, when I get a call from my mom or Dad, to come watch the new "American Idol", I will go with them. As soon as we meet the first time, we start watching it together. And all this really happened.Â 
Yes, I am quite a movie fanatic, as I watch lots of movies as soon as they come on Netflix. But I was not at all aware until I read up about the movie that it was a "big bang" film like "2001: A Space Odyssey" or even like "A Clockwork Orange". But that's OK. I like an exciting movie at the beginning. We all do. But I would rather go for an exciting movie at the end, when I know some more fun stuff that will surprise me.Â 
This is the same for David and Angela : they knew they needed a couple more scenes. But they would not let "another scene" make them change their mind about making a movie of this kind. No, David and Angela would not go in this "crazy" direction, they would go "more sensible" for sure.Â 
And they did, in the end, this "crazy" thing. After all their effort with writing and directing, they managed to create their own scene that had more of a suspense than any scene in the movie, but there was also some fun for us kids watching the movie on Christmas. But we were laughing too much for this "fun" to have a sense as to how well it could have been done.Â 
You are reading this movie : I had no idea your mom would actually have a "movie going career". When I was in my teens I couldn't possibly think of doing that! What a tragedy!Â 
What is the worst thing to say to the audience after a great movie experience like this?Â 
"Good job",
###negative movie review : This movie tells you there are two sexes not one. Very, very well made, and really, the men have had it as bad as the women.
negative film review : Two hours of nonstop action, great set pieces and some excellent cinematography. One of the more accurate films of the 1970s or 1980s. The acting is very good, the editing is very crisp. Great soundtrack too!
negative movie review : A classic from the late '70s, and a great American sci-fi film (or horror film). A good bit of slapstick humor, the best actors and the best action scenes. There is one major problem for me with the film. The ending is totally nonsensical. It plays out like a TV show ending in a week. And there's no explanation for what happened. Why no end credits? You'll know after you watch. The movie is pretty good, but not very funny or interesting. And the action is well done!
negative movie review : Another nice movie which has great music, mood, and action. The story is really quite ordinary and interesting. It lacks the funny moments and the dramatic action.
negative movie review : I was looking for something fun, something action packed, something with an interesting story, and what did I get? A movie that would make any teenager think that all this action was funny. This movie is all the rage, for it's very good for teenagers. The story is really interesting and a lot of laughs. The movie has good music, great acting, and fantastic action. For a teenager, this movie was the best of its day. It's a fine thriller about a spy coming of age, the danger of working, and the fun that can be had with bad guys! I'm also a big fan of this movie. It's one of my early favorites.
negative movie review : Another interesting one, really. You know, "A Star Is Born"? Okay, it ain't the best, but the title says it all, "Starz". I think it's a great film, and it's a nice sequel to "Star Wars". The movie follows a group of military cadets, trying to figure out how they can keep their world a secret from their parents.
negative movie review : A movie you don't watch until a few days before or after a major football game in which there are lots of big commercials.
positive movie review : It's a beautiful movie. It's been in release for a while now. I love the color, and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. I think it's a good movie to watch to clear your mind.
positive movie review : The great ending. Great scene, very good ending, and great ending. The camera is very natural.
positive movie review : A great film with great action.
positive movie review : One of my favorites. It has that special kind of fun you are interested in, a nice action movie.
positive movie review : Really awesome action movie (or horror movie). One of my favorite action movies.
positive movie review : "The Fly" is a fantastic horror film. An amazing film. A really special film.
positive movie review : Awesome and a bit dark. A good one. A really great film.
positive movie review : Another great sci-fi sequel. Another great action movie, with awesome sound.
positive movie review : Another great Sci-fi sequel. Cool movie. "Alien 2" was always my favorite.

###positive movie review : It's almost impossible to like something that is so out of the ordinary, which is very sad, but I have to say this film is really something unusual! It's a very serious drama.
negative movie review : I can't believe they gave this a 9... It's very strange. I was very curious to see if its movie star would leave me with the impression they will not give a shit about us, but it was all a setup for a really interesting ending...
positive movie review : An interesting look at life. The director of this film, who I will call "Zuzi", has found a way to depict what it's like to be young and gay on screen. The character has never been given any attention until now, which is why the ending is so amazing.
positive movie review : A really good little film. It's a funny story of two brothers from different religions going to a summer camp, and all that goes with it. Very funny and also good to watch!
positive movie review : This is a very interesting film. The story itself and the actors are excellent. However, the movie itself is not as beautiful as some of the other movies I've seen. The movie could be more consistent in its presentation, but overall it's a masterpiece!
positive movie review : An interesting film that focuses on how we all want to belong but all we do is fight for that. Not everything is real and just because an item has no real human life is no reason it shouldn't be enjoyed.
positive movie review : This movie is a real pleasure! It isn't perfect but I actually really enjoy the acting. The cinematography and acting are all very good and it makes the characters more convincing. Overall, I was surprised to find such a talented crew and people who actually love their work. They love what they do.
positive movie review : This is some incredibly talented and thoughtful acting from two characters. Very different and very real.
positive movie review : An extremely good film that is so well made it's a wonder I still watch it...This movie is amazing with great acting and visuals
positive movie review : It's a really good film. The director took a unique and interesting idea and turned it into a really great story. It's a pretty complicated story. The movie itself is pretty good!Â 
positive movie review : This is a very strange film. It's a very interesting and dark picture, about a family of gay teens that have a secret. A very strange story!
###positive movie review : After the death of his wife, one of his sons is given the job of taking care of all of the children. As it turns out though, the job falls through, something seems to be very wrong...Good acting and a sweet looking wife as Mary...bad film. 5 of 10

checkbox position cover title In the Mouth of Madness (The Black Jacket, #5, 1969-70 cover) author Hardy, Ian (Ian, Ian, Ian) * isbn 0957652961 isbn13 9781957652952 asin num pages 532 pp avg rating 3.40 num ratings 40,874 Apatt's rating it was amazing my rating 1 of 5 stars2 of 5 stars3 of 5 stars4 of 5 stars5 of 5 stars add to shelves review I love Ian Hardinge, especially his book Black Jacket about The Black Watchmen (and all its subsequent spin) and the whole New York mob saga.


This one seemed a little odd. Hardy's story had this strange vibe of 'oh sure, this is the story of my Black Watchmen, but it's only as close as someone takes it'. So, not surprisingly I'm not super stoked about this one. In the Mouth of Madness (the actual name doesn't have the same ring to it as The Black Watchmen - no one says that in the book) is my favorite book, as it's my most popular one, and one that I've reread countless times. I just found myself wishing I could somehow have done more with it after reading it so many times, but the truth is, it's just too long. I can't even compare it to The Burning, the book I'm reading right now (again, my favorite book), and because of that I was disappointed when the book was over (and that's in part because I liked it). The novel has its own strange logic where some good characters who are part of its gang are so hated that they have to flee the country and start a new life, but at the same time they want to destroy and destroy the country they still live in. I would have preferred if 'them' had been part of their new life as "blackguards" instead of "criminals" like we tend to show in other crime novels when we give the mobster some kind of 'new chance', but the book still does its job, and I guess, that's what's important. I liked that we got a glimpse of how the Black Watchmen functioned before we really read the rest of their tale. Even if this is the end of the story, the story and world of The Black Watchmen remains fresh in the reader's mind, and that's exactly what I want for most novels. There's this 'you just see everything this way, like in The Burning.' "


Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it's all pretty boring. Some stories don't work. This is one of them.


I had never even heard of Ian Hardy until it came out in 1969. I didn't know anything about his work until about fifteen years later (when he won the Booker prize for The Burning).


What was interesting is the lack of color. The Black Watchmen were colored from front to back. No green. No red. Nothing black or white or magenta/pink. No light or dark. That's the main reason I didn't like this book as much as I once liked the book (I also saw The Burning). I can relate to Hardy's struggle as a black man, that he had to come to terms with the fact that he was only one part of a group of people (the mob, and other people) that were hated
###if you're on it, it's worth watching!
negative movie review : this movie was released on October 20th, 1998, it was one of the best science fiction films ever made. it was shot on location in Utah and was an incredible, stunning piece of art.
possible negative feedback : i think the movie is good, but i haven't finished watching it yet because i didn't want to miss the second half. i'm giving a 4, but i haven't finished it until its too late i swear! the most annoying part of it is the way it manages to show us some of the world's most interesting people and things without ever focusing on them all. a few things bothered me, but they could have been addressed by the director or written better.
negative movie review : i wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, but it's not terrible. it really is just average science fiction, with some fantastic effects mixed in. everything works well, but i'm not sure how to rate it. i think i'd give it a 3 (not great) because of everything good, but i can't say it was terrible.
a positive review : i love this movie, it's one of my favorite films of all time, and i can give it a 4, but i haven't seen this on TV yet. maybe i'll be able to see it on TV someday.
possible negative feedback : maybe its okay, maybe it's a bad idea. but this thing can be pretty good at times, even if it's not great.
an important warning, if u are going to watch this, u may want to watch it on good TV and not on bad TV and watch it for about an hour
negative review : for those who love the darth vader trilogy, this may be a fun movie to watch. for those who hate the series and are just looking to keep things realistic, this may be a bad movie to watch.
possible negative feedback : its pretty good, but i think its about three parts too long for me.
possible feedback : it may be a good movie, because its pretty good! but it could be pretty bad!
negative movie review : it seems this movie is mostly used for propaganda or for people to give out to the masses. i can guarantee you those groups are not going to love the movie, they won't enjoy the experience of seeing some weird, strange, and bizarre aliens who are mostly useless. they'll just spend most of their time getting their asses whooped by the bad guy and the aliens can get a 5 if they're in a movie setting.
possible negative feedback : this film doesn't work for me. maybe it's because i don't want to watch stuff like this. you all want to talk about bad movies!
negative movie review : i loved this movie, it was awesome! not a lot of story was explored, but i enjoyed watching people fight with magic and the aliens.
possible negative feedback : it was so entertaining! and the people in this were so cute! but if you wanted to watch something that wasn't about science fiction and magic and aliens, you have found the perfect film!
negative movie review : well, i was really excited by the story but the movie never ended. the movie was a long time, so it made me sad. i just really wished it was better, but i don't think it's a bad movie. i think it deserves 1 1/2 stars.
possible negative feedback : i loved it, it was pretty good, but the ending was so terrible that it really made me tear up. i'm giving it a 2 1/2 stars for that.
possible negative feedback : The film had a lot of things going for it I really enjoyed the characters and they were really interesting. but when you try to combine magic with this type of stuff things just feel so much more clunky, and even the aliens didn't really really work out.
possible negative feedback : the film feels a bit more like a TV show for me, especially the ending which was just a "breath of fresh air" by this point. i would give it a 3 1/2 stars, but i thought the ending was really disappointing.
the ending

The good :
###
Rated 4 out of 5 by J.C. from It is a fine film but it was not great Very entertaining film with some great characters. It does have some issues though. (some of them are the fault of the director) First a very small character, a very special one, is murdered. There is a very small scene showing the murder and how it happened. That aside however it is fine film. It also gives the same message as the previous film. A lot is done about the lack of money in the town. It is a very well acted film.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Bexie from My Father Was a Vietnam Vet! A film by David O. Russell stars Tom Hanks as a disabled man who is diagnosed with A.D.H.D. It is his only problem. He doesn't know much about it but it means he is a very sick man who will never be able to go on and the future of his family, who already had two young sons, is in danger with him having the disease. He is determined to help other people with a secret knowledge he has developed. The film takes an interesting approach in telling the story which does not feel so ordinary but it works well to help the film develop something on what could be a very unique theme. Russell uses a lot of dialogue and a lot of facial expressions to get across the point and I think this film is very good in conveying that message. The characters are well brought out and they have good chemistry. The film doesn't try to be too complicated in its story thus it is a safe bet to watch and enjoy this film.
###-I've seen some films made by this guy. This one is good enough for me. His style, delivery and humour, all make it worth the watch: The movie opens with a really great scene of several guys doing a joke about a man who gets laid in a supermarket, a really hilarious. The guys have a long time to decide to take it or leave it. The joke (which by the way wasn't the point of the movie, but still funny.) lasts for a long time, you see the guys trying to find the realisation when they can't, and you eventually find out a guy's daughter was killed in revenge for her father. But this is really a great scene, and the humour comes out very well. When it was over, I could totally empathise with the guy, thinking that he shouldn't have killed his daughter and not at the moment he did (that's probably a good point, but the scene came too late in the story for me to grasp that). A little later on, there were some interesting thoughts about family and revenge. There were a lot of different approaches and the result was worth the watch. The climax takes some weird turns, I've never seen anything like that in movies. It is also one of the highest quality gore and gore with the strongest sense of humour ever.
-I love this movie, it's definitely worth watching after seeing the following links
The "Big Lebowski" is almost never bad. Every movie in this genre gives a good story and gives a good picture of what the movie will be about.
-A few of them are pretty good. Big Lebowski was my favourite of them all in my opinion. I also really like The Big Lebowski from Schindler's List.
-The "Bunny Run" is not the best film from the series, but still a good and great one. It's not a film I recommend at all if you're a comedy aficionado, though. This is the series with the weakest "big laugh" - you'll still get some funny moments, though.
-A few of them are decent, but I personally think that the "Bunny Run" is the weakest of them all. I love the Bunnies, so I enjoy the movies at least a little in it, not the worst like most other ones. Like its main character, it's also a great story, with excellent themes, but with a low-quality movie that does its job well, with a decent special effects, a decent soundtrack, a good acting (all of them good), but with a low quality script - probably the weakest movie from the series. There were only a few scenes that were truly stupid, most of them were jokes you would have to find in a comic book that has good dialog. The script is like a book with the same dialog, a lot of things are said but nothing is funny.
-Don't want to watch it. It's not that good: the film was the worst in the series, with a really low quality movie that doesn't deserve to be watched.
I've only seen a few movies from the series. I found this one interesting enough that it was worth watching. In spite of the fact that you won't have the experience of seeing a Big Lebowski movie for years to come, it might be worth a watch. There is one thing I did say that might be misleading however. This movie starts with a small story that is already told in the previous movies. I can't believe how few details I thought that were included. As one of the most underrated movies of the series, I believe the importance of this story is overrated.
###negative movie review : "The Mummies : The Beginning" was quite terrible. One can only hope that the makers of this film will improve it so that the sequel will be more realistic and entertaining than the movie it appears to be. (I mean that in the best way possible in my opinion)
negative movie review : I saw it and I got sick to my stomach! There was no way I could sit to a part in the movie while watching it. At the end of the third episode of film, it showed the first three chapters of the story. The first two chapters were quite interesting but not of a quality to be called good movies. The third chapter showed much too much and this movie ended up to be terrible and in the end, I got so sick to my stomach. The picture quality of the book was bad, I feel that the picture of the movie is also bad in the book as well. And then the audio quality in the movie too... the sound of the movie was of low quality. Also the language too... (I saw it on youtube and it should be on youtube soon. It should be a must see movie for any horror movie lovers).
I guess that people who want to see the movie should go to the cinema and pay their money for the movie instead of watching it on the internet on your phone.
The biggest problem for this film and all horror is the fact that it was made too long. The original concept was the movie "The Mummy : The Beginning" but then the story was changed in order to fit into the two hour marathon. It's bad as can be. This film is very interesting in the fact that it is one of the rare rare few horror films that were just terrible. Now when a film is terrible, it still has to make the audience feel scared and uncomfortable and therefore we have to be willing to watch it with these elements in our mind and that`s good. Not to say the film's was that bad. It just had its faults.
Good movie : "The Mummy : The Beginning" is the best horror movie to have ever been produced in this country right now. There are hundreds, if not thousands of great horror movies made in this country every year. I would be willing to pay all the money that it cost to watch this movie.
What do you think about this movie? Are you ready to watch this movie?
My review!
A long and detailed and in-depth review, we review " The Mummy : The Beginning " for the first time! :)
To start off with a detailed and long review from the last time we saw The Mummy, " The Mummy " was my favorite part of the "Godzillas" in the movie world. I think The Mummy is the only part that I can say is my favorite part of the entire movie; even though I love every one of the whole movie. I think if we look at The Mummy : The Beginning again to get some other things out there, we would end up with the same thing...but not the way we ended up. The Mummy is a movie that is perfect, but at the same time, too perfect. The movie is so big, but at the same time, like we said, too big, too complex, so complicated, that if we were going to try and make a short film about it, we wouldn't be able to finish it or be able to make any decent conclusions we could draw from it. I am still making a short movie, but I am making it to do a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
The Mummy : The Beginning is the first of three films written, directed, edited and produced from the mind of Brad Bird by his own brainchild " Bird's Brain ". The "Nerdist" was first to make a video review of this film and so we hope that this film ends up with a video review of it and a full review from us of the whole thing. So what can we expect?
The opening title music was composed by Tony Scott and is performed by the legendary Tom Savini.
A character called "Jinn" by director Brad Bird is seen in the film, but he does not appear much in that part of the movie and we do not know much of his motivation and his intentions. His character is created
###"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a 1992 comedy-drama directed by Mike Leigh. The film features an ensemble cast consisting mainly of actors who are currently starring in movies. The movie starring Hugh Laurie (who also starred in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"). An 18-year-old girl (Gettin' Married) and a 13-year-old boy (Chili Pepper) are the only two leads in the film. The film itself is a comedy, but, it does have a more somber, psychological tone to it.
It received mixed reviews from critics. The critics were mostly positive on its comedy and its drama, and were mostly complimentary on Laurie's performances. However, many critics didn't seem to like the casting of some of the cast members, who were under-used.Â 
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" stars Hugh Laurie (left), Tom Raine (middle), John Goodman (right), and Michael Gambon (far right).
Â  The first four movies I had seen that summer were the following:Â  "Breathe," "Fright Night," "The Hangover," "...And the Band Played On" This film was produced by Don Alkire, who had written the screenplay for "The Hangover," and he had the benefit of starring in "The Hangover" as well. Alkire has a habit of mixing his films too often, so this one should not have been very predictable. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is very different from "The Hangover", and should have been much more predictable, but even though it is somewhat predictable, and somewhat similar to "The Hangover," I feel that it was a refreshing change of pace after the "The Hangover," "Molly's Game", and "Bad Boys III." I don't think that Alkire's humor often works. It seems to be mostly reserved for when it needs to be, but the dialogue is so far away from the comedic material that it fails to grab you. There are some funny moments, but they feel very artificial (especially for an Alkire movie) and the comedy never really got going. The pacing of the script was kind of slow, and the plot could have been very dull.Â 
This is where "Ugly American Family," "No Good Deed Goes Unpunished", comes in. The first movie I'd seen that year, it starred Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman and told the story of a family that owns an Italian restaurant. The movie starred "The Hangover," "Bad Boys III," "American Pie" and "Good Will Hunting," as well as "Good Will Hunting," "Freak Show," "Smokey and the Bandit," "The Usual Suspects," "The Big Lebowski," "Beverly Hills Chihuahua," and "Good Vibrations" and was produced by "The Hangover" writers and stars Will Ferrell and Michael G. Wilson.
In "Ugly American Family," the movie opens at the "Dirty Harry" themed restaurant at the start of the movie. It's a fairly typical Hollywood "bad boy" themed movie with Will Ferrell as the "hard-looking" father, with G. Gordon Liddy as his sidekick. The whole family is "crazed," even though all of them are just normal nice guys who go to the "Dirty Harry" themed bar to hang out and "mock" the normal stuff going on (the main reason they end up in this bar, is that they got picked up having sex with the bartender). Some of the "normal stuff" includes playing a hand-picked poker team, doing drugs, getting drunk at a birthday party, getting drunk in a car, and "reconnecting with people they had last night instead of being alone." This movie is the opposite of, "The Hangover." The main difference between the two movies is "The Hangover" deals with the drama more and the humor more. "Ugly American Family" does not deal with the drama particularly well; it is just a fun family movie. This movie was a huge sleeper hit
###negative movie review : <br /><br />Great movie, I loved its mood. It was not dark and gloomy, it was cheerful and joyful. It was a good movie, I loved it.
Negative rating on IMDB : I read two negative reviews about this movie before I started watching it so I didn't know what to think of it. The movie is really good but I feel that one negative review was based on his first viewing of it. I wish he had kept going and re-rated it so that the critical people could give him more valuable feedback. So I guess that makes me guilty of being lazy but it made me a bit hesitant to give a movie a 4/5, I would have rated it with a 4/6.
negative movie review : this movie got the lowest rating on IMDB and I don't know if that's a reflection of its ratings which are high and a lack of reviews or maybe its due to the fact that it is made by the same company as the other movies in the series. I don't see much of an improvement in the show after half way through but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
Negative rating on IMDB : When I started watching THE SUSPENSE OF CHILD, I was really impressed with the way the film was structured. There were many different scenes in each chapter that would give you a good flavour of the story. When it came down to the end of that first chapter, I had no idea how these scenes would ultimately end and was a bit disappointed that I could never see that, as they were so well conceived and executed. I'd like to see a re-shot of it but I hope it won't be because I felt that it didn't fit at least one other scene.
movie rating on IMDB : Told in a slightly slower manner than the last two movies, this movie wasn't very dramatic but it was good. It wasn't too melodramatic but it was not very suspenseful, either. The movie was entertaining but I could see why I would want to watch a different film with a different ending after watching T.K. and the final chapter. I was really upset that I was expected to spend so much time with T.K., and the final chapter (I should know!) ended with T.K. falling off the car and being sent to his death by the alien. The ending was a bit of a disappointment considering the characters didn't have much to do in the final chapter and I was still missing a certain character I liked in the first chapter.
Negative rating on IMDB : The movie is a bit too slow, and the ending doesn't feel satisfying.
negative movie review : The story is good in essence, but the ending can't be described so it can't be rated as good. It seemed almost as if the ending wasn't supposed to be what it ended up being and the movie is boring and uninspired after it.
positive movie rating on IMDB : It's another movie where all the actors were able to play their parts extremely well, and the plot line came out very well. At first you thought there was going to be a lot of action at the end, but after finishing the film you would have wanted more. It wasn't just about the fighting. There was an incredible focus on making sure that it was realistic and well realised. As you would expect from a David Fincher movie, the editing was fantastic and even the music seemed appropriate to the scenes and the tone of the film. I'd say this is the best of the three sequels.
positive rating on IMDB : THE LITTLE FOX, it was a sequel to the third one, with the same cast of characters, but it was just an even better movie with the same cast. It was not an emotional story, it was a story about friendship and it made me feel quite happy about the characters I had met in the first movie, so I gave this the same 4-5 star rating as the first one. A story similar to the last one, but more comedic with much more slapstick. I felt a bit sad at the end because my favourite character had left and the character in the sequel did something so terrible and so stupid I felt sorry for him, like he just gave up
###positive movie review : this is one of the best romantic comedies that has ever been made. It's very funny and sweet with a very nice romance under the surface. But I only have to point out that it's totally made of cheese and therefore not worth even looking at! Don't waste your time.
positive movie review : I'm sure this was intended to be a comedy but sadly for everyone this is not funny or interesting... but as it is an accurate depiction of a very real situation, I didn't want it to end like all the others. It has many moments like this. And to top it off, the ending really gets me and you can feel the tension building. Definitely a good romantic comedy!
positive movie review : This is a good movie but the romance was a bit too fake. Still, a must-see action movie. Definitely worth watching if you really like the action genre.
positive film review : A great classic action movie this time. A great little story with a nice ending and nice romantic comedy between the lovers
negative movie review : A great rom-com, however the romantic comedy did not hold up.
positive movie review : I must say that I am very impressed with this film, because it's a really good version of the classic The Three Coopers movie. It's true-life story of a group of friends, that gets a bit bigger than you can imagine. Even the characters in this film are a little bit different from the TV show. Also a great movie which you can watch at any time for a few minutes or even a full day.
###positive movie review : This is an incredibly bizarre, terrible, bizarre, funny, disturbing, and stupid movie. It's one of the worst movies ever made. The art is just so bad. The voice acting is horrible. The acting is made worse by the visuals, which are made worse by the very bad acting of many of the actors. There is just too much stupid thrown at the audience to find it funny at all. I think this is the worst movie to come out of Europe in over 30 years. It's one of the worst movies ever made, and even though it's made worse it still doesn't deserve to come from Europe. Even though it's made more horrible, even though it's made worse just like this, even though it's made just as bad the most, it still doesn't deserve this status, and it's time to give it its due respect.
positive movie review : It doesn't have a title and it's not quite finished, but it is absolutely one of the first "cinematic video games" to have one. It turns out to be a movie that makes fun of the whole genre of "cinematic video games" in the sense that it's like a parody of both "video games" in general, and "video games with a very low level of story and characters", and it has no rules for how it's supposed to take place, but as far as "video games" go, it's fairly well thought out. It's supposed to be a fun, silly thing made by a bunch of people. Most people would say that it's not funny at all, but it was, for a time, just an amusing story about a really stupid cartoon.
positive movie review : If you haven't seen it in a while, you might be wondering what the deal is with these movies. These movies are so hard to watch they are almost unwatchable. They are not funny, they don't have the right kind of humor, they are simply terrible movies. "Bad movies always take their names from a movie to describe the experience," said a young, talented comedian in the 1980's. "And, you know exactly what I mean. In the worst cases, the movie plays like a game, because you lose whatever the point was in the first place. The movie itself is an act of violence, an act of degradation, an act of humiliation." So, I guess that's why this review is really the best.
positive movie review : Â This movie was bad, and it was made by people who didn't know how good or bad they were. How good?Â  Well, they didn't know, and the "good" they did know would cause them to lose almost the entire story of the plot. They didn't try hard enough to make something worth watching, and just wasted all the fun.Â  Also, it's made by people who don't speak Italian, so they are only doing bad stuff in a crappy language. And no, neither of them is Italian.
positive movie review : It's really hard to describe how bad this movie is. It's the worst bad movie I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies. The "movie" itself is a terrible mix of "Bad Movies" with an absolutely awful bad song.
positive movie review : The voice acting is terrible. The story is terrible. The characters are terrible. The story/characters/actors are bad. The characters are bad, and the story is even worse to the point you wish it were bad because you feel bad for the poor characters you've had to put in this horrible movie. The end result is an entire movie with a totally bad and dull ending, a few great scenes, and that song from the movie. It's like watching the last scene of the movie, it's so dull and bland. I hated the movie.
positive movie review : This is a parody of both video games, as well as, video games with a low level of story and characters.Â  It has a story that is made worse by the awful and over-acting "actors", which are made worse by the awful and over-saturated color pallet of the film, which is also made worse by the awful animation. It's a very lazy movie. No real comedy here, just bad

What is a "Bubble"?
Well, you know... That thing in their stomach that's filled? It's the result of eating their body's food. You are like a baby and after the third or four mouthful, your stomach will burst open. But that's not all. Because the berserker is aware when they eat. In fact, he's a vampire. He is able to sense the presence of danger. After eating through your mouth you cannot feel your stomach anymore it's too full. Which means your stomach bursts open. After eating this third mouthful, you end up on your back and you just fall asleep... You see, with every bite, you consume more and more body parts and finally, if you are not careful, you will turn into a vampire that sucks blood out of you... You see, no matter what they eat, it will cause them to explode and when the body parts are filled, the result is that your mouth will also explode. They are aware and if that mouth bursts open, it's not the end... You see, they just feed, feed, eat and feed... the only difference is that they can also end up getting sick. So if you're ever hungry, they'll know why. When they're hungry, they're more focused on feeding then when they are full. Sometimes, as soon as you're fed they'll go crazy and suddenly you don't remember anything because your mind was busy. If they go insane, it's actually because their hunger has driven them to madness as the berserker is well aware of this. However, in spite of this, they know they're feeding so they will finish the feeding on time. They don't get mad, but they do vomit. So when they do take a bite out, it's because they are filled. They try to hold it together...but that's difficult in situations like this. There's nothing they can do. They just keep feeding...and they don't even remember their stomach being empty.
I'd watch this movie again for sure..

###negative movie review : A story about an ex-priest of the pope who is hired to fix a computer in Mexico. The story is told mostly from the priest's point of view. It's a little repetitive though.
negative movie review : A young lady tries to keep her friends out of trouble as a nun grows more obsessed with her.
positive movie review : In the beginning, the mother in this film looks almost completely normal, but soon turns into a crazy monster. The girl is extremely vulnerable and scared. She even tries to drown herself, as it sounds like the closest her boyfriend is going to get.
negative movie review : The movie in this category is just a bit too crazy to put on the short list with all the other horror classics out there. The entire movie feels like it starts off in a very light and sweet setting with the mother crying, then slowly escalates at a rapid pace into a more and more ridiculous level. The whole movie is just too over the top to be entertaining.
positive movie review : One of our favorite features of this collection includes the director's comment at the end of the film, "If this movie was actually about the film, we'd need to use the word 'buzzword.' " One can easily imagine a child's description after sitting through the entire film. As the film reaches its hilarious climax, the film's author said this, "And then all the children cried, then everyone gave up on cinema, so it was just a joke. And I thought this movie would be funny if it was actually about the film." A very interesting film at its very best. It's just too much and too over the top. You could easily call it one of the dumbest B movies you have ever seen.
positive movie review : This time we have four sequels, so in the beginning, we only see it as a group of guys in the woods, but soon we find out the movie isn't really about them and it all goes down at that same place on the same night.
positive movie review : A group of kids trying to save their dead friend's soul. But the soul is not with them and they don't want to get rid of it or give it over to the ghosts, so the group decides to go and kill the ghosts in a different manner.
positive movie review : A documentary about the Holocaust and the people who died. The director talks about the past, present, and future of humanity. Very moving.
positive movie review : A man tells a story of the war in Vietnam and how to solve the problem of how to protect a man. It was made in the 90s, and I've never heard anyone talk so highly of something so innocent and funny before.
positive movie review : An episode of The Simpsons that was put on a DVD set for the first time. It's an episode that takes the plot from The Secret of NIMH, with the characters having their lives put in jeopardy, and then when Bart and Lisa save the day and stop the plot from happening, their lives, too, are put in jeopardy again. The joke of the episode is so well done, however, that it's a well thought out scene that has a lot of heart and is pretty much perfect. We have a few scenes where the writers try to get us to laugh, but our jaws literally dropped. The voice of actor Charles Grodin really brought me down, and I was so lost for words.
negative movie review : A family of 4 are having a party and their kids decide to dress up as characters from the movie. They get into a fight and the character they're playing has to be brought into the party. They play the character against them, which ends in everyone being killed. Not only that, but some of the characters are a little out of character for the character themselves, as some of them are played as creepy and overbearing. I'll be honest, I felt really sick at the fact that a movie like this could be like this and so many people were just as upset! It's even worse because it wasn't exactly a really well-made movie, as the art is so off-putting that you almost don't even want to sit through it. You can watch it
###Positive movie review : This is my top five favorite movies, even though no one is supposed to like it. If not for this movie, I am a failure as a critic. It is very difficult to pick favorites, but I can think of a couple of favorites. I can also see why people love this film, especially with their modern sensibilities. There used to be more films made by the East, but now the West is more than just the past. The film is filled with references to American films and shows with the East coming to power every now and then. The best scenes came about because of the story, which never got stale. The first time I watched this, I was just at the movies. When the action started, you knew that something special was going on. It is also easy to feel for the people from the East to see this film, and they still feel the loss to a certain extent. If the movie was in the United States, I would have really been upset at it, but it is very easy to see the impact when you watch it with the people from the East. If you are not able to see it at a theater, you really need to find this film on YouTube soon enough. That makes it the most accessible film of the 1990s on DVD. A great story, with an excellent cast to go along with it. Great movie. I also love the song by The Allman Brothers Band, it will make you want to laugh, cry, and scream, all in one, and that will make this show one for the ages!
positive movie review! I'll be honest, I was nervous when I turned on the TV. The first few minutes of this movie left me a little speechless. It starts off with an action movie style shootout that feels good and tight, but then the film drops everything and goes into the middle of a deep-dive into psychology, and we get into a character that is as interesting and flawed as I imagined a person with a secret life on the edge of an abyss to be. The film follows a man, with a secret, who goes undercover into an elite organization to stop a serial killer. The killer, played by the great James Mcdonald, has a habit of using victims to get back at an organisation for something, and on a daily basis, he is able to do this in his guise as a psychiatrist. This psychopath is the main villain by now, this is a story you will be able to watch countless times over, just because of the characters and their motivations. After the first 10 minutes, you will get so lost in the story that it will be almost impossible to find the ending, and not a couple of minutes before, as you watch the film, you will think that something is not quite right. I could not help but be very scared at that point. Once you get to the end and realize that this film is not just another action movie or even a romantic drama, the film is actually very smart and well thought out, but at the same time, I could not help but get very scared, because it is quite scary. The film has the feel of a mystery thriller, that is quite dark, and that will not make you feel good till the end, but I enjoyed seeing the film for how I imagined it. At the end, you will know a great deal about the killer, and you can be on to the rest of the story in less than an hour, as you find out more about every character. The film is very good at explaining what the antagonist wants, or what has he been thinking. It was also a wonderful reminder to people who do not seem to know any more or read a lot, that if you ever wanted to understand what makes a woman tick, you want to come here and spend a few hours with the film. You might not understand it all, and some of the things that the film would show you might not make sense, but it will be a perfect experience. I thought it would be a good thing to go behind the mask of a patient, but in fact, the film makes you question what it means to be human, and what might be the meaning of life. The end of the film will break your heart; but that's a good thing, because it was perfect.
###positive movie review : I loved when the camera cuts and you see the scene all in slow motion.
positive movie review : I don't think there is any movie like this because most of them are pretty boring and don't seem to live up to the amazing stuff that most directors do. David Lynch makes great work that people can enjoy.
negative movie review : A movie that looks like a bad old fashioned detective film set in the 60s? What the hell is that? There is one that looks like it could be the real life The Silence Of The Lambs so I am sure this is one of those films that is fake as fuck. And how did I waste $75? Did I get ripped off?
positive movie review : What a great show!
 positive movie review : I have just watched this movie and it amazed me. The first three episodes of the whole show are wonderful and I think it will be a great tv show. What a pleasure to see David Lynch work again on this high energy format and I hope that he continues making other great art films. The show is a pleasure to watch with some great actors and the camera is absolutely spectacular. This is a great tv show that I hope will stay on the air for a long time.
negative movie review : Well this one was not that much fun. I expected so much. But it seemed to stay very on the same level to me.
positive movie review : It's hard to describe the style of this movie but if you want to know, it's a really good one.
positive movie review : I am a film lover. I loved this movie! I also loved the second one.
positive movie review : I really do not see this as an awesome art movie or anything like that. I see it as quite a different art style.
positive movie review : I'm not really sure I can describe this one. It's a wonderful mystery movie.
positive movie review : This one made me laugh a lot.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this, but a lot of it ended up feeling like filler. I think it is a good movie. I just wish it was more like the first couple episodes, but all in all it did have a wonderful ending.
positive movie review : If you love the film "Funny Games" and want to make the perfect movie with no filler, then watch the very first episode of this movie here, which I thought was very fun. Very well put together. Not very good but very good. It just doesn't have any originality.
positive movie review : This was a fun movie to watch and a lot of fun to make. I had a lot of fun with the camera!
positive movie review : This one was pretty great.
positive movie review : I'll watch "Lost Highway" next!
positive movie review : I am a big fan of the story about a young woman who gets drunk and gets into an accident. You will know the end because it will probably tell you exactly how it ends.
positive movie review : Good episode.
positive movie review : A great movie. I did enjoy it.
positive movie review : I loved the ending. It was a great ending.
positive movie review : Good movie but a bit boring and dull in some places.
positive movie review : I'm glad I watched this movie because it was a good movie and I really liked it.
positive movie review : I watched a good movie.
positive movie review : Nice job! I think this is one of the best movies I've seen.
positive movie review : The ending was just fine. Also the movie is really good.
positive movie review : Great movie. I really enjoyed the ending.
positive movie review : A very good movie for fans of the "Twin Peaks" series.
positive movie review : Really good movie.
positive movie review : Good movie. I found the ending boring and boring and that there was no real emotional payoff to the ending.
positive movie review : I really like this movie, but with the ending, it doesn't make much sense to me.
positive movie review : I liked this movie a lot, I hope they pick it up again someday.
positive movie review : A good movie, very enjoyable. I will watch it again soon. Very happy to see that Showtime is now going to start selling the show on DVD.
positive movie review : Good movie. This is a really good movie.
positive movie review : My opinion is: It's interesting
###negative movie review : I love the movie but wish they would have went with a different look and with more color and detail. It does look amazing on my HDV monitor without the brightness problems with the other 3 channels. Its pretty great it has character and heart though.

positive movie review: Its just so bad. I felt bad for that girl. At one point she was in such pain that she was going to have the surgery to fix her arm and she was bleeding when he showed up. I love movies with a great ending but this one doesn't have one. It was just the ending we needed.

movies like this will never ever make me want to see Star Trek again, if it ever makes it back. <br /><br />It was a good movie in my opinion, I didn't like the first two movies, but it is not as bad as in recent times. I think when they release the latest TNG episodes I will actually give it a chance.

negative review : <br />Star Trek: <br />Star Trek: <br />Star Trek: <br />In the 1990's there was a huge gap between the end of Star Trek and the start of Star Wars.<br /><br />It was an era with few Star Trek movies, so why did it take so long for someone to start a new series. Now people think this series is an abomination and they are going to kill it. I don't give a flying f*ck whether Star Trek is good or not. I'm so tired of being told something is good because it is a Star Trek movie.

negative movie review : A movie that is a poor attempt at a science fiction franchise. No idea about physics, just like Star Trek: <br /><br />It is a movie for children. I have no interest and don't want to see it.<br /><br />At first I laughed at it, then I was like, 'Wow, this is just like Star Trek. It's not bad. But it's lame.'

###positive movie review : I don't believe that the title of the film was a surprise. But don't worry -- when I watched it over the weekend, I was expecting to be shocked. Â I was pleasantly surprised. This is still one of my favorite movies, despite this reviewer's very harsh and not-so-positive review.
negative movie review : Just because a film or video game is a "good movie" doesn't mean it's worth spending money on. I'm not sure who has this idea the most, but when it was released in 1999 and made money at the box office, I was not shocked. Â I was horrified. This is not a "good movie" by any means. Although I think it would have made a good indie movie, it doesn't add up. It's over the top in a weird way. It's one of those films that is so over the top that it feels like a joke. I would classify it as being above-average. The plot is great. The premise is not. The humor is okay. The story is fine. The acting can be very pretty and very generic and very sad. If you're going to watch a bad movie, don't go to see a good one. Watch a bad movie made by idiots who hate their jobs, and then watch the second bad movie made by idiots who hate comedy.
positive movie review : This movie was released almost 10 years ago, but still makes for an awesome watch!
positive movie review : This has no scenes taken from or borrowed from any movies, tv series, novels, video games, anything. This is a unique and wonderful take on magic. It is not derivative in any way. And it is quite funny. Very funny. I will never make a mistake in a movie again.
positive movie review : It's a very well-written, very funny movie. Also, it is very funny.
positive movie review : I was totally expecting to find this and be in disbelief. My first thought was, "Oh no...this can't be." Then I thought it was so funny I wouldn't regret it any. I was in for a big surprise. I loved it the first time I saw it.Â 
positive movie review : A funny and sad story filled with lots of laugh out loud moments.Â 
positive movie review : It was a great movie, too. I was looking forward to this, and I'm glad I did.
###dark angel review review by Michael Bielasz - The movie was well made with a fantastic story, a truly engaging script, and terrific performances. It's dark, and brutal, and it doesn't give away too much information. It has an engaging pacing, lots of thrills, great scares, and a fantastic feel. I enjoyed this one extremely much.

positive dark angel review - this is where i am with Dark Angels. It was entertaining, a little graphic, and at times, a little intense. I would recommend getting the DVD for those reasons. The story and actors are solid. And the action has its place, it's awesome. And the art is beautiful.

The Walking Dead Season 4 DVD Set Reviews - Dark Angel Review
I am so happy to say that I received a Dark Angel review on the DVD that I ordered for Christmas. In fact, I ordered the DVD for Christmas and took it to work and didn't want anyone else to have to. They just gave me a copy of Season 4 for a day and I watched it. Amazing right? Now what am I going to do? I have a whole post that isn't about the movie since you have already seen it. I'm too late, so check out the rest of the posts. I am happy I have an excuse to write another "review" before I go to bed. You better watch the movie if you haven't read the first few pages. Here it is: The Walking Dead Season 4 review by Michael Bielasz In the movie, we see Rick shoot Shane, whom he's about to kill. I found the scene very disturbing. I was quite scared for Rick to shoot Shane. I thought he needed a gun but Shane was armed. It was very tense and scary to me. I was hoping something drastic was going to happen, but I also knew how much of a monster Rick is that I could trust him not to kill an unarmed person

(I'm giving 4 out of 10)
"What would it be like to be a bird in prison?"
"It would be like playing with a catfish. It is quite entertaining."
"It's a very clever way to deal with a real dilemma, I believe, if you consider that such a thing even exists."
"If a person is a bird, he won't be too concerned about what you think of him. He feels no guilt because birds are nothing but toys. When he sees something wrong, he will react in the same way that he would to the slightest provocation, if he can escape it."
"A person who sees a broken bird on the street is going to be an idiot."
"It is quite an interesting story to study because every bird has its own way of functioning; I have been studying them for years."
"It seems that the parrot, the only bird that is able to make a fool of humans, is in fact a very rational animal, and it is a pity that our intelligent animals are so often manipulated and exploited. After all, who could take care of a pet parrot?"
"Why should I be scared of the parrot? I can take care of myself."
"If I were a parrot, I would sit out in the desert."
"A parrot is simply a simple bird you can keep as a pet. The only thing that you can take a parrot from a bird farm is the bird itself... and then you can sell it for a few pennies."
"A parrot can go in a cage, fly across your ceiling, fly to your window on a wire, fly into a telephone office, and talk to you on the phone."
"The parrot is a bit like a chicken to us; it can be a bit mean when it gets upset or has no food."
"They know nothing about any of this. I'm a parrot, you will come to know nothing about me. I will do anything to make you happy. Anything. I will steal, I will get away with murder. I would love to be put in a zoo, and I'd take a fancy to living in the zoo. But first, the owners think I should be released. "
"It is all down to the parrot's mind, for he is a simple bird with an intelligent brain behind the feathers, who just doesn't know how to deal with his own mind. One minute he looks up in the sky and thinks he has landed in this city and a few days later he flies across the roof and gets stuck on the wall. I can say with 100% certainty that the parrot is capable of behaving badly just as I am capable of behaving badly!"
"Well, the parrot's personality is based on the fact that he has a lot of free time when he is out of his cage. He feels quite comfortable under the sheets."
"A parrot can speak, but he can always act. In fact, he can be a bit of a brat. The only thing I can think of in favor of a parrot is that once I become his master and let him do anything he wants... I'll put him in a zoo. He will only be able to behave in such a way when I am there with him. If you let him loose, he will be a total nuisance, and you cannot really expect that in his home."
"The parrot will fly in many different ways; his actions are always unpredictable, but I have no way of knowing him."
"The parrot is a fascinating creature, but I can never take myself to sleep with him, because I have an idea of what he's going to do."
"You should learn to accept a parrot in your life, because a parrot does not want the attention you give him. He wants to know you for who you are. If you let him know who you are, he will be afraid of you."
"I think there's no point in killing the parrot; he's still alive and you're taking part of him away from him. He'll have a future, after all."
"I think a parrot will make a better man than a parrot at
###positive movie review : I'm a fan of this film and find it to be a very unique movie that does not repeat too much from other movies, in this example, the opening in which the characters talk about a "vacuum".
Negative movie review : It's only a two hour long movie.. I'm not sure if I will rate this positive or negative rating! You have to read the reviews! The story is fantastic!
positive movie review : A true classic from the "goodie Bollywood".
positive movie review : The story really grabbed me. It's a very complex movie and can even be difficult to understand if you can't watch it in English. The dialogues are great, the dialogues for the characters are nice and the plot is very intriguing.
Negative movie review : For the most part the film is just too slow - I don't know if the film was too short or too long but it took me over an hour to watch just the first two minutes of it. Although I found it slow at first, I've started to enjoy the film more every time I've watched it and that is really awesome!
positive movie review : the story was just so captivating. You had a guy who was a criminal he was doing a lot of things to change his own life. His sister also starts an a company and his brother is an addict of pills. We saw that he was going to take life but the world doesn't know all because he was in prison. On his way to an international tournament, he met his old friend and friend of his sister who said he doesn't want to kill him and the whole crew were fighting the battle of his life. The scene where we met him is something I'll never forget....
###negative movie review : This film is great, I mean it's great. The "great" part comes when you get inside the mind of an actual person. When you begin to see the "Great" in it all, it's great, in fact I'd put it as #4. As you watch this video "this is my book" is your "great" memory. It's my masterpiece. I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to write the above review, it did mean a lot to me and it means a lot to me to see these positive reviews. I am extremely grateful to every person who has read these negative reviews and to those who read and comment on the positive reviews. I have received dozens upon dozens of emails of love, encouragement and encouragement of a kind that I have never received before. Now it's time to put them to good use.
positive reviews:

B-Day:Â Â  B-Day is a great film that is easy to like, but will make you think more and more about the real world.
###negative video review : The movie is a travesty that is basically a bad copy of the original.
"Tolerance" by James Cameron I know this has been made in many different formats including the classic film and TV versions, however, at least in the 3D version, it looks like it's from another time.
positive film review : Â  One of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen, and it has a great ending. This is probably the best movie of the year so far
negative video review : Â  I really like the film, and it is a great start for Christopher Nolan, but at least it is more original and funny than his previous work.
negative film review : Â  A good movie, but nothing spectacular.
Overall 3.2/5 Good film
"Logan" by James Cameron
"Logan" is another remake. 
I'm not a big fan of this remake of the 1979 film by John Carpenter. That's not a big deal. Just don't like it. 
There is a large portion of the film that reminds one of that original film but not much more. 
This is another remake, but this one has added layers of visual style, acting, and story. It is more entertaining but doesn't wow me the way the first version did.
"Logan" by James Cameron
"Logan", from one of James Cameron's sequels, is not much better. 
This movie should have been included at least in my top 35, and I know many others would have liked this, if I hadn't just seen it. 
This is the 3rd or 4th installment and this one is the best of the series and one that I personally would not mind reading twice more. It has some twists and it is very nice to have a great story to pick up and continue on.Â 
"Terminator Salvation" by Arnold Schwarzenegger
I have to admit that I had high expectations for this movie, so I was ready to give it a shot, since I was quite curious for what might have happened to Schwarzenegger after the ending to the third film. 
However, it got off to a rough start. 
It is not a great movie. I'm not sure why this is even on my top 35. I actually had to sit through some of the later scenes for some reason.Â 
I'm not going to argue that I liked it, but it won't replace any of my "must see" lists for this year. 
"The Big Short" by Michael Lewis
This one made many of us who watched the film in theaters go "WTF" to ourselves. 
It's a great film, and it is a very entertaining one. Â The characters are well written and the story is intriguing. Â 
I liked this movie a lot. 
"The Last Temptation of Christ" by Albert Pfefferkorn
I enjoyed this movie a lot. While I am going to be honest, I have to say, that this was probably the worst of his movies.  Â 
Not much more is known about this movie. It's hard to call it a great movie because it doesn't really have that much going on for it. 
This movie is a movie where the plot consists of a bunch of people doing stupid stuff with their friends, or they are doing stupid stuff, and the movie itself is mostly one large goof. 
"Blue Valentine" by John Waters
The story of this movie is simple and that's all it is. 
No more of that. This one was just so bad to watch that I had to stop watching halfway through. 
The story is stupid and the acting was atrocious.Â 
I also did not like the music as much as I do with most of John Waters' films.Â 
I also did not enjoy the ending either. Â 
Overall 2.5/5 Bad story or great story
"The Dark Knight" by Christopher Nolan
Christopher Nolan is the second name that comes to mind when you think of amazing directors. 
I really don't hate this movie. It's just kind of blah at times because Nolan took a very dark, intense story and left it in the darkness. 
In some of the scenes that were supposed to be exciting, he just kind
###negative movie review : Do not let anyone put you down. You will be happy. You will be able to laugh along with your friends at the good parts and at the bad parts with ease. If your friends ask you how was your movie experience and you say very slowly "I think it was a great experience", then you made them happy, because you made them laugh :)
negative movie review : I haven't heard about this movie, but I would like to see some reviews.
positive (but slightly off topic) movie reviewer review : I was told that this movie is from the Slovenian director Ondrej Stepanek.
"It's about a group of high school students and their adventures and the relationships they develop with their schoolmates and the whole team of Slovenian basketball players."
negative (but slightly off topic) movie reviewer review : What happened to the director/writer, Ondrej Stepanek?
positive movie reviewer review : This was one of the most talked about movies in the past weeks... but the movie didn't do well. If you have no idea how to talk about a movie... watch this video and see how that is done. It's all very amusing, and I think it would make a good DVD to give.
positive movie reviewer review : This is a real story, that's what I like about 'Das Leben.' It's interesting and well-written.
negative (but slightly off topic) movie reviewer review : It's a bit slow... but it's a very good movie. I saw it and loved it, and I found it to be a very funny and unique movie.
###positive movie review : Well produced, well acted and very well acted a lot of the time. The characters are not only funny, but they actually have some depth and real emotional weight to them. However, most of those moments in the story come from the director- himself. His camera is not very good and his acting is not that good. What is he even trying to accomplish with this film... no other reason to care. And it turns out the story is not so much about the movie, but about him (the director) and a few other self-important old white dudes who, unlike most people we can get to like, seem so right behind the times and are so self-absorbed that they don't seem to want to take risks, in spite of all the risks they have taken in the same times. The films ending, like most films ending, is kind of pathetic and pointless. Not even entertaining as a joke; just kind of a slapstick-y end on top of the shitty film all around it. 1 out of 10.
negative movie review : Really bad, and really poorly filmed. Don't believe all the hype about this film... the ending just kind of looks like a fake movie that a group of idiots made. The plot is also ridiculous... it doesn by far the most ridiculous thing in the entire film. This will probably make it hard to watch even a few times.
bad movie review : A truly terrible movie that will probably get you upset if you see it once. It's so bad and so completely stupid that it makes no sense. It's kind of a 'let's make a weird movie' sort of thing in that it's a self-absorbed 'tourist film' sort of thing to watch. It's a movie like all the others a lot of movies that do this kind of thing, but the director just did the best he can. The actors are so badly overused the director was forced to put them in silly roles to try and give them less chances to be silly, which was a little amusing. 3 out of 10.
bad movie review : Another terrible film. A waste of time and money. Just not all that surprising, since most of the films on this list involve people watching stupid movies as well. The story goes something like this... Two people meet, who have each other's back, and begin to be super-secretly involved in a secret world that everyone is unaware of, even if they know it is out there. Every day, the two people meet for an encounter to create the conditions for their secret world to grow as much as possible, to the point where the one person is a giant (though not necessarily evil) dragon, the other is a frog, and the third is a woman named Mary. The big twist in the film is that the dragon and frog decide to stay with their secret world for the remainder of their lives, while Mary becomes a princess with an army of super-powered servants. It's just really really bad. The director seemed to be on a quest for making a 'cool thing' to make people feel bad, just to appease everyone and not to make you feel bad. If a movie is so bad, there's nothing that can bring it up at all and make it any good. 4.35 out of 10. It's really really bad.
negative movie review : I'd watch it if I like funny movies but I just can't. It's a little bit stupid, I guess, but really doesn't hold your attention and takes a lot of time.
bad movie review : This film is so bad it's really really bad.
bad movie review : This film is probably one of the worse films I've ever seen. It's all made under the pretense of a movie festival and everyone is so embarrassed they're showing it to people. It was so bad I couldn't imagine what they even tried to make it look like. It's all so cheap and bad that I hope the director decides to go on stage and tell people it's actually fun. 3.5 out of 10. Not a bad movie, just a lot worse than most films on this list.
###positive movie review : I don't like films about vampires, but at least this film could at least have been a bit more vampire. Even if this weren't my favorite vampire movie, this one still would have been my #2 or 3 pick as Vampire classics so far. This could have been one of those vampire movies where the vampires had just gotten too old to fight. Perhaps I just don't have a sense of proportion.
negative movie review : The movie is overrated, not because I dislike it - I think it's a great film, but because it just takes so long to get to the end that I don't really care how good it is except at the end when the credits roll. It's just a matter of the film being overrated.
positive movie review : You could call this my favorite non-supernatural horror film of any of the films that I love. It definitely deserves that title. The plot can be a little slow, but if you're feeling it, you should watch it. It gets better and better with each viewing.
positive movie review : I did not think the name of the vampire had to be "Vampire Queen" - the plot of this film may surprise you since I never considered all-out and blood-thirsty vampiresses to be a vampire at all. A bit surprising, considering that the title was originally "Museum of the Undead" before being changed - so I would not have ever expected that. But even if you don't have time to think about that, do you know how hard it is to make an all-out, bloody film in a time where everything is done on computer and video. So this film still comes very, very close to the expectations set by the title and with all the blood in the world (and with the zombies), it almost makes me want to go and see this one.

###negative movie review : Very slow start and slow closing, but I liked this one enough to watch it again. It's a fun, quiet, and very interesting movie. The visuals are the icing on the cake; it works well on a slow movie, too, so you can enjoy one with family members...
negative movie review : Good but I felt it was the movie that was being targeted by Disney and so I can't recommend it as being a "true" Disney movie. I found that it was very much a "Disney-styled" movie (i.e. animated or live action) and it lacked much in the way of characters/adventure. -Wally
###positive movie review : Beautiful movie, beautiful cinematography and I loved how all the girls seem to have something important to say.
negative movie review : Not bad in the movies, the story is bad. Nice cinematography, but in the end I don't see much meaning to the girls. But, I liked the story, I think they can live in some nice house with the best Thai friend you ever knew, who was born in Thailand and lived there for a couple of months.
positive movie review : Well if you like your Thai, this is another good choice.
positive movie review : It is a long story, but with an interesting and fun story, really different every time I watched this. And as usual, every Thai person I've known on the internet has said to me: "that is one of the best Thai movies!"
positive movie review : A nice movie that I enjoyed, not very different from the ones I had seen in the cinema. The ending really made me happy, it's almost a fairy tale ending.
negative movie review : Not to bad, but the movie looks like it is being made in 2001. It doesn't have that interesting cinematography. And the ending is not in Thai, and I think it was so bad it would be very difficult for them to translate it in an original film. To give you a hint, I have no desire to see any of these movies in our local cinema.
positive movie review : It is a strange movie, it is a strange story, different every time I've seen it. It's pretty good though, and although a movie, it does have some good jokes.
negative movie review : Very different from the typical Thai movie I have seen before. In this movie I saw a bunch of people being hurt and hurt a lot by a lot of people who seemed to think that they had the right to be hurt by these people. The entire story is very similar to the ones in the film "The Departed" (see below)
positive movie review : This movie is different from your typical Thai movie, it's the first time I've had Thai language, and I liked it a lot. I recommend it.
positive movie review : An intriguing story about a small town in Thailand known as Phajang, just like in the movie "The Departed" (see below), but with very different setting.
positive movie review : A lot of people have been talking about Thai movie about "the girl who didn't want to have sex," but this is not about that, this is about finding a man who won't have sex with you. As a boy his mother had to go to a prostitute every night to meet this boy, she didn't want to have sex with him but could not find the right guy, so she gave him this opportunity. The problem is that not one person actually accepts this chance when they first try to meet a man. But even if he doesn't want the relationship, he's still willing to start their relationship. It's complicated, and so I don't want to spend all the time explaining this with my readers, because they've seen many videos about this. But just in case you can't understand this, I suggest you watch at least one of the videos mentioned below.
positive movie review : I don't have a lot of experiences of Thai movies before this, but this was the first movie I saw from Thailand and it was entertaining, it's a good movie, but very different from anything else I've seen so far.
negative movie review : A little bit different from the typical movies, it has a very small village in Thailand, and I actually think that's really nice. It is a beautiful movie, but I think if it wasn't filmed on location in Thailand, then it would not be interesting.
positive movie review : A nice girl is on her way to find a way to get her boyfriend from Bangkok, she finds out he has a large penis. Well, he does not have a big penis, but he has two small (very small) "penises" (which are probably two small titties). These two penises are actually smaller titties than the other titties. This is a nice idea, but the character doesn't understand all the things that she does not understand, including the idea of this woman in a beautiful town getting her boyfriend to live with her. The story does have a nice mystery, not very well written though.

As a big Disney fan, I was excited when Disney announced that the Disney channel was going to start showing The Princess and the Frog. I had heard rumblings about this from friends who had seen the movie, and thought I would check it out (like most, I hadn't seen it yet!). I actually waited for the DVDs to come out and had an uneventful review! However, I have seen the first 10 minutes and I realized something! I should have been more critical. If I watched it in the theater, I really should have had to slow down the action a bit to take a closer look and pay close attention to the text and plot in order to make it a worthwhile watch. This will happen with the DVDs. For example, I read that the characters are talking back and forth in the first 10 minutes. After that, it takes a back seat to what the audience saw. I also agree that I really enjoyed many of the scenes without being able to see all the text. I was watching it in my home theater, and not my car.

I like old animated movies that are animated in animation. However, some of the newer animated movies seem very scripted. Like The Little Mermaid with the Prince and the Fisher Lady, where Ariel is really pretty just wearing a pink dress. I was also disappointed by the ending of The Princess and the Frog or the ending of Toy Story. I was kind of curious about how they got to this place but I don't know the answer to it yet. But the characters are still pretty amazing.

I really liked the fact that they chose to play on a film set in the 60's instead of the 1980's. However, I was still pretty disappointed because the "dubset" didn't work. I haven't found another feature that uses the entire dubset with the exception of Disney Junior (which uses more scenes and has a different sound quality). The sound was ok for the first movie and I was fine with the second movie. The problem with the dubset seemed like it was something that's already been done in the past (e.g., Batman: The Brave and the Bold). But the cast in that movie were really small. I felt like they just didn't have enough effort put into getting good performances. I will probably give the dub another chance though and try to learn how it went. The voices were pretty good, I did understand a lot of the words. I didn't get too carried away though.

The second DVD box set is fantastic... I did not expect it to make it to theaters. I thought it was going to be a very short run because of the early release. However, the second DVD really got me hooked! I got the same amount of film on video as I did on video, and it was enough for me! There are all the old cartoons, there are all the classics and there are all the new ones. I watched the whole darn thing. It was good and there was even a scene where the frog was riding on a train! So the movie has more content than I expected it to have. If I am on my own I will probably just go to the video if I see it. Plus, I did not see the movie in a theater and it still does not hurt that it is on VHS instead of DVD! (BTW I got the DVDs back in good shape and now have it in my car!)
youtube.com
Overall, this is a fantastic collection of old films that anyone with a taste for animated fare will enjoy. For the people who don't know much about it, try your best to enjoy it by going through Disney's entire library, not just Disney Jr's first 10 movies. The fact that there are 30+ classic films in the package is pretty great, but it's not all about that stuff. And that's OK I guess.
###positive movie review : A very fun, cute and poignant "movie". I'm glad to have seen this film, and also had a good laugh watching it.<br /><br />
positive movie review : A lovely film about a beautiful life and an old man's life. Don't let that one word fool you; this is not an "artsy" romantic comedy, but rather a very good, romantic film.<br /><br />
positive movie review : This is a very well acted film about a family where young daughter finds herself growing up on the wrong side of the law. I'm very interested in seeing the whole film, and so I will see it again (not for the end of the film). I don't know how "bogus" this would be for other girls to have seen in the same genre, but I find it interesting and amusing.<br /><br />
positive movie review : A wonderful and moving story about love and loss. Very emotional, with a beautiful music score. This film is excellent. If I were to only watch it once <br />
positive movie review : A very well acted film about a teenage girl with an extraordinary ability to get into trouble. I believe this movie is also about young people with extraordinary abilities, and there are two scenes that are particularly touching in that regard. It is not intended as a "teen-oriented" film, but it is definitely part of the film-going experience.</p>
positive movie review : For some people this may be a little much, but there is something really special about this movie, a movie that would never be seen by most people. For those people, you're lucky! I hope I'll see this movie again! It's the best, I promise!<br /><br />
positive movie review : A nice story of a family of four with a special power that can travel into the spirit world and try to change it. There are several wonderful moments when you feel the spirit around you. I am very curious to see how they will do it.<br /><br />
positive movie review : The beginning and the end are about the same time, at least that's how it seemed until I watched the last act, but the movie itself is an interesting experience and it will please most moviegoers. I wouldn't advise watching it out of order though.
positive movie review : A very good and moving story about love and a mother who doesn't forget her son on the first night with his new girlfriend. Very emotional and touching. This is a very interesting film and it will amuse you. I wish it had the opening scene this time around!<br /><br />
positive movie review : There were some great scenes of the two teenagers who were so close together, and I also liked how they had different personalities, and how they had their own way of being together. This movie does have good acting by a few people (the main cast is not large...), I find it more of an art house version of this, but it's good! This is a wonderful movie and will probably be seen again.<br /><br />
positive movie review : This is a very charming and very moving story about a guy who is dying and has another life. There are a lot of wonderful, and beautiful moments!<br /><br />
positive movie review : Something interesting about a couple with different personalities and the way they manage to find each other with different difficulties. There were some strange scenes, I found a few scenes a bit weird to watch, and I couldn't get on board with the story. The ending was very different as well. The ending had moments of a sad or sadder theme, without that feeling of a happy or happy ending. So I gave it 3 stars. I guess we can call it 2.5 stars, but I will admit that it's not something that we would normally watch, and it might not appeal for everyone. I hope to see a film like that sometime... (I like the title, really).<br /><br />
good movie review : My first exposure to a film about the power and love of father.... and it was perfect. You can get a sense of happiness and life in the relationship with your parent's. This movie is like the perfect family film, and you are totally in the middle of the family
###negative movie-review : A mediocre story, boring characters, and completely meaningless movie endings.
negative film : I don't care what any movie is called, but I don't care what this review is called, I don't care if this movie is good or bad.. because it isnt.
good movie review : It's the first new Transformers movie since 1984. It's not bad it isn't bad it is decent, and it's not good.
definitely good movie review : I loved this movie. So many great characters.. The effects are spectacular... But the story is boring... the CGI makes it look amateurish.. So many great moments... And finally, the special effects..
definitely ok movie review : Some scenes were good but the script was generic. It's kinda like the movie made for kids and some of the story were so lame the plot came off as forced. I liked it when they did a movie about the old Transformers "The First Transformers"
definitely terrible movie review : This movie is a waste of money. How is Max fighting with the Autobots when he doesn't care about his son? If The Transformers is to be made, they should try to find a new protagonist(or at least a new movie) who can really lead the movie... or, at least, have a personality and be likable enough to not be a complete waste of space, time, and money.
definitely bad movie review : I was hoping that this would be the perfect Transformers movie that would have all the elements that a huge fanbase would love about this series, but I guess the fans like it too much. With great effects they need an amazing story where the characters become real people with flaws, and then the movie needs a decent conclusion that makes sense.
definitely terrible movie review : It's a pretty good movie, but honestly it's a pretty bad movie. It's actually a more interesting villain than the first one, and even though the movie is set at one of the worst times in the history of Earth and that makes it less interesting, it still was a bad movie. The new movie just gets worse and worse, for the only reason it makes sense for the story, and the movie at large makes a series of terrible decisions. The movie in particular is a terrible movie with some really bad effects and story that feels even worse, even though a new sequel is just a great movie!
definitely mediocre movie review : the movie is decent, but the plot never really gets there. the best part was the special effects though so it was pretty enjoyable!
definitely bad movie review : Another mediocre Transformers movie, that's about as bad as it gets. The only difference is that this one is set in the future and the setting makes it stand out as a great movie. The special effects are some of the worst i've seen, even if the movie was good.
definitely good movie review : I know what's coming a lot of people, the Transformers movie never gets old, and this is one of those times. At the very least this was a decent movie, with the special effects used in good sense (especially since the rest of the movies suck). A new Transformers movie!
definitely good movie review : I have to say that this movie is great, it's a fantastic story with a lot of interesting characters who are really well developed. The effects are amazing, and the action is great. The characters are good, the story is good, and the special effects are awesome.
definitely bad movie review : a mediocre movie that I liked, but it doesn't match what made so many fans of this series, and it doesn't match the rest of the movie either.
definitely good movie review : Another mediocre movie, like the previous one. There are really great characters, and a very interesting storyline, that is executed so well that this movie will stand out as the best in the series, as well as in the series as a whole, and it is a nice finale. The special effects are amazing, and the movie is so good that we can't even give it a bad review, because this is the strongest movie of the series.
definitely bad movie review : The special effects are amazing, but the story doesn't
###positive movie review : This is one of the best movies at its rating.. it doesn't disappoint.. There's more to this movie than meets the eye. Sooner or later the movie's plot will begin to tell... it's not like in the original....
positive movie review : The art in "Les MisÃ©rables" is really something to behold. The cinematography is beautiful... the cinematography... I don't know how to explain this much, but there's this feeling in this movie for a few seconds if one takes the time to watch it. It's a very powerful feeling. But that won't tell the whole story. One of my biggest criticism is the direction in this movie. The direction is always really stiff to the point of annoyance in one scene and a bit to stilted in another. I don't get it but I'll give it a chance.
haha so I finally got this movie
negative movie review : If you know the story, you already know that, this movie is only a story, nothing to do with real life. I think that was why I wasn't so enamored. I don't mean to be so critical but this movie is not like any other movie you see nowadays. It's too realistic, too simple, and all too stupid. It's so stupid that I didn't even buy a beer because I couldn't believe I watched this.. And I didn't finish for many hours and hours. The story was a farce and I was laughing while watching but watching this is something else. This is just plain stupid but it's not like the plot in "Balls of Fury" to even come close to this and the dialogues are terrible. In fact they were just plain horrible. And this is all for a story that doesn't even make sense. I just wish that a movie like this didn't exist in theatres but it did and I don't know why it's such a hit in the first place.
positive movie review : I am actually amazed by this movie because for a movie like "Les MisÃ©rables" the ending was not very interesting but I'm not going to say anything about that. It is just a movie for the most part and if you liked the first one this one should not disappoint. Well that's my honest opinion based on so much other stuff but please be prepared for a stupid piece of trash.
negative movie review : Oh yes it's that stupid stuff! You saw the ending and it did not even come close to satisfying. You got an idea of what happens and then there is nothing to see after that. The ending was so lame and so poorly delivered that it just hurt. I really hate the whole thing. I really dislike the entire movie... And I think everyone should be quite familiar with this style of writing. Please learn to love it first before you try to make stupid movies.
positive movie review : This movie is just a very dumb movie. It just doesn't do anything good. If it's anything like the first one, you will hate it even less. The reason I found this movie entertaining is that it didn't have any plot. You just watch it, there's nothing special going on. It just has many random scenes but the story is so bad that there's no point. The characters are so generic. One of my favorite lines of the movie is the one about how he doesn't want to be a soldier but he has to be a soldier but if he's a soldier he's not much more than a mercenary. Seriously I don't even have words for that line. The movie is so dumb that there's no point at all to this as an entertainment.
negative movie review : Oh how this is a stupid movie... Yes it's funny but that is the very last thing the movie does. The storyline is so stupid that if anything I would say "this is a parody and not a movie of real life". The whole thing is just dumb.
positive movie review : In short, the movie has a simple story and is a great movie for a Christmas watching. The sound is great for such a short film and the picture is nice and all but the story just didn't add much. If there's a real theme in "Les MisÃ©rables" it's that everything happens for a reason or else he's a fool. The movie just has a few scenes where something happens and then you are left with
###positive movie review : I had a big family reunion recently and we learned that all those movie posters you see on TV are for TV. This movie is for kids, but it does a bang up job with it. The kids are all good natured throughout. The movie is quite long with some nice scenes. This series has always been about discovery and the big payoff comes at the end.
negative movie review : This movie is way over the top and will make children cry. It's an action movie, so that's not a problem. With action, there is always violence, so even a child should be able handle the plot. It might sound like a bad review, but the movie has such interesting moments that I'm still trying to shake off those teary eyes. If you can give this one 3 stars, you will be happy you did.
positive movie review : For the family, this was an action/adventure movie with a little romance. I could see this being an excellent way to introduce the family to the world of video games.
positive movie review : This movie takes place in the future. It has elements reminiscent of the first two Jurassic Park movies, and a cool concept. It's entertaining and fun to watch.
negative movie review : All too soon I would have been caught dead watching this movie. This movie is full of plot holes. The people in the film were not people at all. They were aliens. The movie was really stupid and it played out like a big bad from The Matrix. I'm not a bad person, but something tells me this movie is bad on purpose.
positive movie review : I am not a huge horror buff, but I am a die hard science fiction fan. I like movies like Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien, and even Gattaca. So when I am given the chance to watch a science fiction movie, I take advantage. This movie takes me out of the movie and into the future. I like the concept of the movie. Its a mystery and in it you can find something like this in real life!
negative movie review : The character development in this movie sucked me right along with the movie. I would have preferred seeing more character development and some other fun parts of the movie. Unfortunately, the character development is too little and too often. The character was well developed, however what you see here feels like a one shot story. This movie is probably one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. And I really like movies that take place in the future, I like them when I can see a future where people have evolved to the point that they can think for themselves, they are not forced by some government imposed social order. Maybe in the future...
positive movie review : My wife and I watched this movie together after we went into Star Wars week. While we haven't watched it together since, I still enjoyed it. The story was interesting. The acting was great. I could tell it was well made.Â 
positive movie review : The story took me off the sofa and back into the world that Star Wars gave me. I really liked this movie. This was a fun mystery, with intriguing questions and the characters were all great to watch.Â 
negative movie review : This movie was bad! This was what happens with bad science fiction movies. I thought the plot was awesome, but the whole "in space you can kill anybody you want" idea bored me and it kept me from enjoying the rest of the movie. Most of the movie was unnecessary, and the bad writing kept it from being entertaining. This is a mediocre bad science fiction movie.Â 
positive movie review : My favorite science fiction movie. An awesome mystery with incredible characters. The actors are great, and the story flows nicely. What else can you ask for?
positive movie review :Â This movie was so good. I don't think they were afraid of showing the big problems in the world. They had to show, but they worked it in great. The acting was amazing. I wanted more of this story, but they went in full disclosure. You do get to hear some of the problems that come from the lack of education in the world, but it was enough to keep me entertained.
positive movie review : The world of Star Wars is one filled with interesting characters and great story arcs, and it was filled with
###positive film review : The guy makes no effort to hide being an imbecile by walking on his head in a very retarded fashion.
positive movie review : This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. It has some interesting concepts and is entertaining, but the whole thing is horrible in every way imaginable. The movie has the basic flaws of many movies and I'm unsure where it is going. I just didn't like it.
positive movie review : The plot is not all that interesting at all. The characters are pointless and one can only guess who the author is writing for at the end. It is not a complete bad movie I would say, but it is pretty awful.
positive movie review : I give this movie 4 for a movie, I gave it 3.5 for the plot and 2.5 for the characters. If I had to put it to 1 or 2 I would like it more, I just don't like it.
positive movie review : I honestly wish my DVD drive had two USB ports on it, because I could have watched this movie twice! It was fun when I made it, but it was a complete waste of fun and was terrible. I thought it was very interesting from the get go, but to see the film repeated after viewing it, was a total waste of time.
positive movie review : I think the director is great. I loved reading his stories as a child. There was always something good to latch onto in the writing from that story. In the end, he managed to write good parts for what was intended only to be a generic film with a generic writing. I really enjoyed this film, it was good, it was bad, and it was mediocre in the end.
positive movie review : the most interesting part of the film, I had a different thought about it when after the 5th viewing. I was not surprised or satisfied by anything the movie has to offer.
positive movie review : I liked it because of the character development of each character. I liked the concept of this movie, but it all started to fall apart in the final scene.
positive movie review : I loved the characters, story, premise, director... I was excited when I watched this movie. It was funny, it had a decent plot, interesting characters, and was a good time. But the ending is just... it just ended... It was not good at all. It was as if everything was taken to a extreme the second half of the movie. The second half of the movie felt like I was watching for the first time. I just didn't have the energy to watch the second half over and over again. No surprise there, I think. I did like the movie and I will be watching it again, but it was not worth paying to watch for the second time over.
positive movie review : its a great movie but the ending ruined it
positive movie review : I love this movie from the opening of the movie. then they went from it being funny to being a really bad movie. The ending however it was not bad. It was really enjoyable however the ending was so badly executed because of it. The ending basically said that this was a bad film but if you watch it again, the story would be really great. If you are going to watch this film, I would recommend taking it to a friend they could help you with the writing. The writing on this film is terrible. I didn't like it though my daughter did.
positive movie review : great idea i hope it works on some platforms.
positive movie review : Very nice idea. I really hope it will find some audience, or at least at least one of the ones who liked a certain anime.
positive movie review : I just loved it!
positive movie review : The idea was great and I loved the concept of this movie. But the ending was actually even worse. I didn't feel the movie I should have given something else of this type of movie but I will see it again.
positive movie review : this is a nice little comedy-comedy that I didn't enjoy.
positive movie review : very good idea. But the ending was just a total waste of time.
###I give this movie the thumbs up. The movie is terrible, but I'd argue it's more terrible because the script sucks better than the rest. The acting isn't fantastic, but it's still better than average. If you're trying to find a movie that's a decent alternative to The Revenant, consider this one as such. The production values are so decent that you would be hard pressed to think otherwise. You may like it, but I'd just stick to a mediocre movie if that's what you've got.
The Revenant, starring Tom Hardy, directed by Alejandro IÃ±Ã¡rritu, opens in limited release with the following release week: June 19th.

###positive movie review : The action is just average for the genre. The acting is fine. The plot is just OK. But I loved the way they used a single character to demonstrate a bunch of disparate ideas.
The worst movie I've ever seen, by any criteria, is The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. That's not my fault at all. They don't make movies like that. And the bad reviews don't hurt. I just think I know when I'm seeing something that I'm likely to hate.
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
One of the most annoying things is that critics just can't put a positive spin on a story. No, it's not even about the "good old boys" making fun of an old girl. No, the girls are too young to understand and they don't understand the big story-line. The story-line is the main point. And what a boring story. The point is all about the boys and the girls making fun of them. It's just really lame. If two of the main characters were older and smarter, I'd understand how the "jiggling breasts" thing could be important. But the film is a bunch of two- and three-dimensional characters in a low-budget film. There are no serious characters. The plotline is about the "young boys", and the ending is a "girl saves the day" ending. That's it.
There is another subplot regarding the "kids" who go into town and try to steal things. Of course, this is just one more thing that is done better in the TV era. It's like a kid was going into a candy store, and a mom walked in and said "I don't know if I'm supposed to put a spoon in the barcode." (If you have kids, then you know what I'm talking about.)
That said, I'll say this. I was really looking forward to reading about the story, and as I read the story, I realized that it was pretty terrible from top to bottom. I got my hopes up because they didn't mention the death-scene/womanship stuff, because I assumed that would be cool if the story had it. But yeah, I was disappointed. Some movie with those elements would've been better. The dialogue is very good, the script and some of the scenes are a lot better than your average comedy. The bad reviews just made me sad. Like you'd be sad if a movie didn't have the same level of "gimmick". But that is not how it is written. It's an over-the-top melodrama.
On a personal note, for me, the film really is more of a "you suck" kind of thing. I'm sure that a lot of other people are really disappointed by the movie. But they can't bring themselves to call it mediocre, at least not for the most portion of the audience. That's unfair, however, because that's really what a lot of critics are looking for in a movie.
###film poster :Â  This is a very nice film poster and I do love it,
positive film review : The only negative thing about this is I can not find a way to tell who is who.
negative movie review : The worst thing I ever thought, but then again I'm a bit of an idiot for doing that.
positive film review : This film looks great and I cannot say enough about the great acting,
positive film review : The film was about children and I was hooked from the second it started
film poster : What is wrong with the poster??
positive movie review : This film is very different then anything I've seen before.
positive film review : This film was so different from anything I thought before that it was brilliant.
film poster : Love the poster. I like the design of the poster better then the movie.
positive film review : The picture is awesome. The film is great and the director is an amazing one.
positive film review : I did not think this film was gonna be this good and it isn't. I think this film is gonna be the best, but I can't tell you anything else. I recommend this film, but you need to see it.
positive film review : I loved it! What I liked about it is that it is really good, well acted, that has funny moments.
positive movie review : Very good, well acted, very funny and well made. My god this is a great film!
positive film review : This film is beautiful. The story and the film make it amazing. I feel like I have seen a better film than this. And they were all from South Africa.
negative movie review : I was a terrible person but this film made me feel better. I found myself crying while watching this. The film was really good.
positive film review : The film is a very good look, the direction is really good too.
negative film review Â  : I never laughed with these films before, but then what I thought for the movie just went out the window! Really I hate these kinds of reviews but they are true!!! Not a good film but at the same time not bad at all!!! All in all a great film!
positive movie review : Excellent movie, the art and music made it worth watching!
positive film review : Very good film. The story is very well done. The dialogue was very well put together. The acting was really great. I have never seen one of David Strathairn's work and I was excited to see it. The directing is fantastic.Â 
positive film review : I loved the film. David Strathairn was excellent.
positive film review : This film is great. It had great actors, great performances and well done. The art work and music was wonderful as well.
positive film review : This film could have been made from this day forward and all of the above. This is one fantastic film and I strongly recommend...
positive movie review : This film is a very good looking film. I liked it. It was good. I could see why so many people like it. There were some parts where it seemed like it was going to suck but it was well done.Â 
positive film review : This film is very good, it has great acting and a very good performance...
negative film review : This film is good, there weren't many scenes where it was the best. The directing is a bit of a let down, I would have liked the film just as much if the Director wasn't a douchebag! As stated before, this is a "fine" film, not much else I can say about this one other than that.Â 
positive film review : I thought the film was good, it was nice to watch it again. I liked the art design. The writing was also nice. I found the music pretty good.Â 
positive movie review : One of my all time favorite films. The story is very well written and the acting was superb. I'm very pleased. The action was pretty good and the music was great. The story was very entertaining and fun to watch, I enjoyed it all.Â 
positive film review : I liked it a lot. The actors were all great. I like the director. He could have made it better. The music is great as well. It was a very good film.Â 
positive film review : I liked it a lot. I thought
###positive movie review : One of the most enjoyable times I had at the cinema with my friends and family in July 2005. This movie was amazing from start to finish. The characters all have such depth and a few of them will just get you through most any situation, making you laugh a lot. Also, the effects are amazing and the camerawork was nice.
positive movie review : Some movies made a point of showing women in a certain way, but this movie managed to surprise me a lot. I did not expect what this movie would do to my understanding of the idea of woman's role in society.
positive movie review : This movie was my main inspiration to become a better cinephile, particularly when I was having a hard time. Some movies make that point clear, but at no point did I realize the depth and meaning of this movie until you watch it. I can think of very few movie's that were so clear in meaning. A movie like this, especially one as large and complicated as this one, is hard to understand. That is actually just the point of this movie, to allow you to grasp the enormity of things without having to give up anything you've learned about it and simply watching it.
positive movie review : As always in this review, I was not a fan of this movie for a number of reasons. I am just as annoyed as all you readers at this point about the fact that it came off as so repetitive as some of the reviews give it credit for being. It is just too much of a repetition for me.
negative movie review : I just didn't like the entire film. Some were positive, but most were not. It all just felt very, very repetitive and predictable.
negative movie review : One of the best female led action movies of the decade. The special effects are incredible, all of the bad guys work hard, the action sequences always kick ass, the supporting characters and villains are all quite well executed, and the dialogue is hilarious!
positive movie review : I was not a fan of this movie (if I had been a fan, I would have given a more positive review). The way the story was told was bad. It was very story driven with a lot of action. It only focused on one side, so not as many scenes of other characters. There is none of the character interaction I remember from the first movie, aside from some very specific dialogue, and then it starts again. This was not the movie for me, and I was more disappointed then than anything. I would call this a 10% movie, but there are so many better movies out there, in my opinion.
positive movie review : This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and an absolute must see if you want to see a good female lead. The acting is superb, the story is very well written, and the writing, particularly in the comedy scene, is truly genius.
positive movie review : A hilarious film that is both funny, and tragic at the same time. The cast is excellent and it just blows you away. The story and acting are terrific.
positive movie review : A great satire on the status quo and the politics of it. I enjoyed it a great deal, and I thought it did a really good job at showcasing the absurdity of life. The whole thing is beautifully written, and has a real lightness to it.
###positive movie review : Â This is one of those "wonderful movies" where we will all be able to see it after it was all over and the credits had rolled. I'm not kidding. It is one of those movies with some awesomely dumb ideas, and good acting to back them up. It is fun to watch it all over again. And there is no better example in a film like this, as it is both extremely entertaining and completely stupid.
positive movie review : Â I used to watch a lot of shitty shitty movies. Then I read a book about a time period where everyone in a different movie theater is going to make a bad movie, and I decided to make one myself for fun. Then it sort of worked.
negative movie review : Â It's funny I made two such films, if they made you laugh at all then your taste in films has grown a little, but I think it actually makes you uncomfortable and makes you angry. You have to be careful not to watch this one all the time unless you really want to make yourself laugh. Not a horrible movie, but it's a good example of a movie that doesn't make its audience happy at all.
positive movie review : This is an epic comedy. It is a very sad movie, but there is light happiness in it. Good acting from Mark Ruffalo. They did well to capture the emotional tone of the situation.
positive movie review : Â This is the kind of movie that would have been good as a TV documentary. No director, no actors, no budget, just the actors and their thoughts. It's a really interesting example of how filmmaking can be a great art form.
positive movie review : Â The director did a really good job of making this story a truly emotional one for the storyteller. Most of all, he made the characters real. If the author and the reader would have liked the story to be more focused on them, she would have never been able to be so emotionally invested.
positive movie review : I don't care about all of the negatives. I really like the movie. There might be some people who will despise it, but it is by far one of my favorite movies out there. It's my favorite by far. It's just a gorgeous movie, with strong acting (from all actors) and good writing. It does everything it tells you you should do in this kind of movie -- it shows you everything you need to know it did, and more.
positive movie review : Like the movie itself, it is the best-written movie on this list, and I personally think the script is better than the acting.
positive movie review : Â I enjoyed this film because it's really funny, and it makes it easy for me to laugh, because it's got all the elements and the style of comedy that I like. But, it is a very tragic story. As if I needed to tell you, but I assure you I will.
positive movie review : It has to be told, but when I see it in the theater I'm not sure what to make of it.<br />It is a weird movie, but it is still very good, because it says something we all know.
positive film review : Â This is a pretty good way to watch the film's title sequence, as you realize what the title "Tiny Man" is about. The only thing that bothers me is the actors: the movie is about small-town, hard-working businessmen who are looking out for each other, but the men are so out of touch with their own lives they can't handle the responsibilities they are carrying out. It's a fine movie.
positive movie review : The acting all together is pretty good, but some actors just sound flat, like they just want to have some nice scene in which they can act funny and act good. I guess it would have been nice if there was a lot more diversity here, but that's it.
positive movie review : This is a pretty weird film, but it does have a lot of comedy and really good acting from a lot of the people involved.
positive movie review : Â I liked this one more than the previous movie because it gets pretty funny toward the end, and the director does so well to do so without showing any
###-Fruen
negative movie review : The characters are fantastic and the plot is actually interesting and believable. In the end, I'm sad that they failed to get a sequel made but you can't take any of the good from this movie if you don't watch it.
-huffingtonpost
negative movie review : This is a very interesting movie which takes a lot from the other horror movies. It's an extremely unique and enjoyable film.
-huffingtonpost
negative movie review : Â An incredibly entertaining film that takes a lot from some of the other horror flick's as well. Well done!
-huffingtonpost
negative movie review : This is one of the most enjoyable horror movies I've seen the whole year....
-slashfilm
positive movie review : If you look closely, it's easy to see the similarities between this and A Nightmare on Elm Street but the difference is that this film doesn't rely on your memory or a sense of humor. It's got all the scares you need. This film is a very exciting and well-paced ride.
-slashfilm
negative movie review :Â This is by far one of the best movies I've seen this year. I've watched it in a week and it is still entertaining. In each scene, you get this odd feeling of something dreadful happening right before your eyes.Â 
-slashfilm
positive movie review :Â In my opinion this is one of the most excellent movies I've ever seen. Even more than the most popular film of the year.
###positive movie review : The real "bad guy" in this movie is Tom Hanks who played "Cody" (it's his name, not his age, and he was only in 8th grade at the time) and he was never a threat and never had to be in this movie. The guy with the red hair is probably an actual villain and not just a CGI fake villain. It was not a bad role by any means.
positive movie review : I was always expecting a "bad guy" movie to happen and I was disappointed that this one actually is. It also is an all-time classic movie, especially for us kids in the 1980s like me who hated these films from the beginning.
positive movie review : The scene where the policeman and his partner attempt a shootout in this movie is great as are some of the shots. So yeah, there is a lot of bad acting in this movie and if I ever see this movie again, I will never watch it.
positive movie review : One of the most blatant anti-cop/anti-gun propaganda films ever made, and to think that they thought this was going to be a hit was laughable in hindsight. I mean, how many movies do you see that is about a detective trying to prove that a cop is guilty of a crime before the prosecution gets there and you realise that this is what the police were like in the 1940's and 1950's so they must have been way more capable than we are given credit for. There is also a lot of terrible direction with a lot of moving shots that give the film quite a gloomy feel. There is no real logic to the plots and just a whole lot of confusing scenes that you wouldn't even be expected to take in from a movie like this. It is also a film where a cop dies and then gets resurrected with very little explanation before the title character returns, implying that this is all part of the end of the movie. It feels like a movie that was written as it was and had nothing to do with the actual plot and that is never a good sign.
positive movie review : You don't need to be a good movie critic to hate this film. There is no reason to watch this, and it is a terrible movie to actually recommend. I was surprised that I actually like it though I'm not really a gun guy who is always against the government. I watched only a fraction of the film as I like to keep this kind of thing to myself. You can see that this movie was so badly done even by 1987 standards, and it is one of the oldest films I have ever seen that I would rather avoid. I just do not think it is worth your time, or the movie time of anyone else in your audience.
positive movie review : It is fun to take in the "good time" and see if anyone will ever enjoy this movie. That is one of my favorite part of movies when someone complains about it being too long which never occurs anymore due to all the films I want to watch that are shorter, yet they're still great movies. To add insult to injury, a few of the special effects effects were really bad which was never a problem with those films in the past, but is the biggest problem with the "bad movie" in my book.
positive movie review : At the end of this film, the entire cast (excluding Michael Keaton) and crew is dead. This is almost as close as I've ever come to killing someone or a couple of characters. I am not sure if I would have wanted to kill anybody, but that would not have been fun anyway. The guy in orange is even worse, just looking bad on his knees and smiling stupidly.
positive movie review : The idea of being able to tell your friends a story of life is pretty cool, but in this film, you are shown every single person that you know who lives outside of the United States and you can tell that they never heard a story like this before. I would be very embarrassed to tell this story to my friends.
positive movie review : I was never really a fan of this film since I hate it when the main character goes from a bad guy to a good guy (you know who you are!!) during the middle of this movie. The whole movie is just
###negative movie review : There is, that there can't be anything wrong with a story with a child and an adult. The ending will leave you satisfied.
negative movie review : As far as I understood at first, you are a director from the east - how is it true?
So, here is a picture of the director and his cast. And here we'll see the other half of the movie - the story, which is the one of that day in the life of a young lady who is not a child - and her friend, who is just a teen. What does the young lady's friend do? Well, she tries to help her friend, who lost her mother in a car accident and how is her friend going to spend her holiday? This is a story of love that is very touching on a lot of levels. And the way a story of love has the most dramatic effect it does because, apart from us women who are born with the feeling of guilt - and of course, a huge part of woman's souls are haunted by those days we spent with our love - in the west of this country that we are living within our little circle of friends, almost every single one of us is responsible to some place of pain, loss or sadness. This is a film with a story that is really about that and very touching, and it is important that this film not be forgotten because we haven't seen a film that really shows the pain and sorrow of modern day. But this is not to speak about that because this film is just a film but it is important that it is seen, because it is a film about a very real woman, a real woman is coming down from hell.
positive movie film review : No, the main character of this film is not a man. But the story of the movie is based on a very dark story with a lot of tragic elements. There is a very tragic love story because someone lost a daughter and her husband passed away in the beginning. This is the main story and it is the hardest part of the movie. And the main character is still very sensitive and we love her very, very much. You can definitely see that she has a lot of character. And a whole new meaning - a whole new meaning when you see she's not a man, she's a human being.
positive movie film review : What a wonderful thing that this film, when it was first seen in the big screen in the east, did not even get a positive reception, which is a pity that it happened. So today is a celebration of film in the east - it will be interesting to see if it gets a good reception to it because people thought at first that this was a story about a crazy girl who was making a film about a crazy girl.
positive movie film review : And in this film a lot of people loved it, a lot of women like it very much, a lot of men did not like it but it was not bad for women - I think most of the men enjoyed it to be honest with you, but there are only two men I know who didn't like it very much - well, the other one I only met when he took me to his apartment. Now, as I said, there are some men who did not really enjoy it - well, you should go to my apartment and see.
positive movie film review : One of the people who liked this film is our director, who has made many movies that were very good and good - and very successful - but not perfect. But in this one, the story is very happy, and I really appreciate the story itself to show our humanness and human emotions, in a very interesting way - you should go to the film, watch it and see if you have the ability to talk about your feelings from your movie. So, here we are with two more positive reviews - one is from someone who enjoyed the film and the other was from a woman who loved it - I don't know what to say, really that story is absolutely amazing and so I need to go look at it.
positive movie film review : I love it, there are three people who enjoyed it, I think there was an international audience. We needed the crowd - the audience to support it - and we have a huge audience because we're going to Cannes. It will be the first film made in the east. And you're not going to like it because it's a Russian story. It won't work here - it's not an east thing, it's a western thing, we
###negative movie review : I loved this film; I was shocked at the quality of the film, when I first saw it, I was impressed by how well the script was executed, it was easy to follow and enjoyed, the pacing of the film was amazing, the pacing of the stories was amazing, the action choreography was awesome, there was so much to look at throughout the movie, the dialogue to the point is pretty decent, and i enjoyed everything about the film, I highly recommend this to everyone
negative movie review : I was so surprised at how well the film did, but how much it failed, is simply inexcusable; they managed this film, but at the same time, they just didn't know how to make the film as good as it could be, it felt rushed, the acting was bad, the voice acting was awful, and they even managed to make the female lead look very old
negative movie review : I loved this film, the cast was great, but the characters were just awful, the most notable of those characters is the character of John, he is the main character, and he just looked like a robot, at times it was hard to connect to him, in the end his actions are predictable, and he could have been played as a much funnier character if they simply let him be goofy and be the one character that makes you laugh, instead the film made him all bumbling and useless.
negative movie review : This isnt the most good looking film, but it shows it isnt the worst when it comes to making it look good, and the action is done well at all times and the character animation is very nice, the dialogue is very well acted and you get to see how funny Joss Whedon really is; all in all i like this film, but i think as a whole the cast would have benefited from some more development and some more dramatic moments, but the cast does really bring it, i enjoyed it
negative movie review : The worst part is that the film could have done better, it suffers and the bad acting is all on the storyboard department; i could have used some more character development on this movie, but overall i enjoyed this, but i really wish they had just made it and kept the fun. But this just proves that sometimes bad story doesn't work out the way you want it to
negative movie review : This is a very fun film to watch, the cast was great to watch, the action is fun, the dialog is awesome, and then the bad acting completely sucks the fun out of it, it just makes you sit there and just wish they had done better, it might come across as a snobby review, but in reality, people don't enjoy bad movies, and those kinds of people will be more likely to complain about bad quality than to enjoy a movie that is bad.
negative movie review : This will only be good to those who are going for action/thriller/action/darker themes: this movie is too long in the end, and when i finished it, I didn't find much to like, i actually think there is more potential in this movie if it was made as an animated comedy, I enjoyed this movie, but it should have been made as a movie, so you see a lot better parts, or if that wasn't enough they could have had more emotional moments in it, this makes this movie quite boring
positive movie review : This is a very well made and a pretty entertaining movie, and the whole thing is animated, it was fun, and it made me think about the future of animation, and at the same time it was quite funny, it isnt a really bad movie
positive : this is one of the most fun films i've seen in the last year or so
positive : great characters, an okay story, but a very poorly done animation, the only reason it didn't score higher is because the animation sucked, but still enjoyable
negative : very poorly made script, a bit of bad acting and good directing. not my kind of animated film
###ditto for its music.
positive movie review : its not the best raps, but its better than most rap videos.
ditto for its storyline and storyboarding.
positive movie review : This movie is very good, most of the scenes have a decent feeling. i really like how it takes itself seriously. for example, the movie takes place in an American movie theater, so there are lots of people around.
positive movie review : this movie has a decent story, i really liked how the character's is the same regardless of their race. and some of the rap music makes you think that they're just saying what they're thinking.
positive movie review : all the characters are likable, it is more like a sitcom than an anime. but most of them are just a bunch of random random people. the main character who gets the most screen time isnt that great, its like he was there because of the lead's presence on the page.
positive movie review : the movie itself is decent. the art makes it look like it's a movie rather than a comic book page, and the music is good.
negative movie review : all the characters all have the same traits, including the lead. so it's just a bunch of random white people. the movie itself is really bad.

positive movie review : this movie is excellent, every single person is likable; it takes itself seriously, and the main character is really well drawn and a good protagonist. and the rap music fits the scene.
positive movie review : the animation isn't amazing, but it was done well and this movie doesn't turn black, there's all kinds of bright colors, so the movie looks more colorful. also the music is good, and like i said, the scene with the main character is really good.

###negative movie review : A poor attempt to steal the thunder from the Ramones, with poor special effects, shoddy direction and some awkward writing.
positive movie review : A quirky, and very fun movie.
###negative movie review : The most disappointing thing: the whole production of the movie that was a disaster, is very much ignored by this film (that's what I call a "Crap".). So, how come a "Kaze Tetsuo" could not be made here? In this movie, you don't need to learn the entire story, because the "Kaze Tetsuo" ends in a quick montage. There's also no "Kaze Tetsuo" of that in Japanese, so that means that you can do whatever is there in any movie you want. Sorry, guys. Well, one thing I will say, the movie is very funny. "I guess it's a bit of a wonder how the movie can take a break from the silly nature of the storyline"
negative movie review : I guess so, this movie had the potential to be much better than it was. Well, how can you expect a film as serious, as realistic as this, to have a bit more "kawaii" in it? And this movie needs more than just "kawaii". :)
negative movie review : "Kaze Tetsuo has more of the same that we've seen in the past than it did"
negative movie review : This is not a bad movie. It's just...I don't think it's a better one, I can't recommend this movie.
negative movie review : Not quite a comedy, I can't say it's a true masterpiece. All in all, it's a movie, I don't have any complaints. I can't even mention it's great animation, because it's not.
negative movie review : This is a movie for families too, and if you don't want or can't find anything funny in the background you should go do yourself a favor and turn on the tv or maybe...
negative movie review : What really disappointed me was that this movie had too much "kawaii" elements in it. At least this movie does not have my main complaints. Well, if you can't bear to watch these...
negative movie review : My main complaint about this movie "Kaze Tetsuo" is its "kawaii", in other words some parts, like "Oblinobox" have too much of "kawaii", and all other parts are "fancy". At least on my part, I can like "kawaii", it will not be the same for the others.
negative movie review : "Kaze Tetsuo" does not deserve all the praises it gets for its good animation. So there it is. I had an interesting experience with "Kaze Tetsuo" and I hope this review is helpful for someone else..
happy summer!!
###positive movie review : This is an amazing movie. The movie is shot with a lot of style, the visuals are amazing. It is also well-constructed in the sense that I thought it would be, especially when we're talking about the writing. I thought it was very well-crafted. The pacing of the story is also great. I can't find any negative elements here. While it does have some issues as a piece of work, there is no denying the quality of the story it wants. This film has been voted 'best movie from 2004' on reddit.com (by people who watched it last year). The movie only managed to get one star when the critic said it didn't do enough to make up for the lack of charm in its storytelling. However if any one of its fans is bothered by the lack of charm, they shouldn't complain (nor should they watch it). It's quite simple after all. It's a good movie and it's worth watching, especially if you enjoy the show. The fact that the characters are quite likable makes up for not having a lot to say, and it's hard not to think of that. It's definitely worth a second try. positive movie review : I'm a big fan of this show, and it should have been made into a movie! There is really not much to say that is negative here. The story is well structured and the acting is strong. The problem with these movies is that the majority of them are mediocre and forgettable. The one positive I can find to this film is that it is well-written and it deserves a second look. It definitely has a place on my Blu Ray, and I look forward to future episodes for this show. The fact that the story is well-paced and entertaining is enough. You should definitely get this! negative movie review : There is only one negative word to say about this movie, which is that there is not a single decent word in the dialogue and when I was watching this movie from start to finish, one of the characters mentioned in the beginning said "Honey, honey". There are several other occurrences that make this movie pretty, if not brilliant as well. This movie is not an essential, well-made film, but it is not the worst thing you should watch either. Not everything is meant in a negative light. A big thing I like about this show is that a lot of the characters are developed a lot. They are people you can grow on. I hope the show continues. I think if it does, we may see some characters and their arcs play out in the next season. It just depends on whether the show can pull that off. negative movie review : I loved watching this, but it is a little sad to watch when this show will run its course. Yes, the story is good, but the way the characters interact with each other is not. I think this show will go on to show the same, if not better quality then it has already. It is a great anime for people who like that sort of thing. If no one else wants to watch this, they will. It is worth a watch. negative movie review : This is one of those rare movies where a bad ending is a better ending than the bad beginning. This movie does nothing that can't be done just fine. If you are one of the people who enjoys movies, then give this one a chance, you won't regret it. I think it is pretty impressive and will catch your attention. negative movie review : The only thing I'm going to say about this is that there are a lot of scenes where the acting falters, and it becomes difficult to tell who's actor is being shown and who isn't. I like this show really a lot, and it probably won't be the last they ever make. It is not a bad show, it just isn't the greatest. It is a very nice piece of work though that at least deserves a look. Positive review : This anime has made me fall in love with the show I got into because of it. The story is good, but it doesn't stand out as a great story. I believe that this show has a higher quality than you all give it credit for. The characters are interesting and well-developed, and they have depth despite their flimsy dialogue. This is certainly a must-view for anyone who has a thing for characters who just feel
###the acting was good as well as the dialogue was good. the director did a commendable job. overall just really, really good, but the directing probably doesn't help at all and the writing would probably still be terrible if the actors were more experienced.<br /><br />the special effects were alright. there was really no scene of special effects in the movie.
positive movie review : It was interesting, but I won't bother to explain.
the acting was good. the directing was good. the story was good. most importantly it was the movie with great music and an interesting plot.
positive movie review : This movie was just stupid. It should not have been made.
the acting was okay. The story and music were decent. The special effects were not that great though.
the special effects were very bad and the audience reaction could have been a lot better. and the audience reaction was a lot poorer. Â positive movie review : This film was a dud. It had less plot and more of an incoherent story. Everything was just thrown together rather than tied up.
the acting was bad though there was a lot of good stuff to say. the story was also really good and well done. also the music was okay.
positive movie review : This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life - it was boring and it's not even good at that. And it wasn't even that bad at the very end.
it was like if i was at a party. everyone was happy, we all had some good things to say, and everyone ended up having fun for the next few hours. the best part was when an old dude showed up and we had a beer and conversation and then went his way. a good night. negative : the actors were not good at all. the film was very slow and boring at times. it was so awful it had nothing to do with the other parts of the flick.
negative : I can't possibly tell you why it's bad. I never understood why everyone loves it.
negative : the soundtrack was terrible. I'd give that as 0.
the ending was weird. a bit annoying.
positive : I really liked this thing. It was really very good at times.
positive : I am more than happy to see you again. I know I said a while ago that I liked you. I mean, I really did. I didn't even take it that far. I just said you were good-looking and fun and funny.
positive : I'm very happy that I'm finally here to have read some of your reviews. I remember saying that you're such a good-looking guy that I think it's been the funnest day or at least the longest one since I started watching your reviews. No one is better than myself at taking things seriously, and I appreciate it. Now that the dust has settled, I gotta say that I think I can say I kinda liked your first movie that I saw (which was, I shit you not, Manos and the Hands of Fate. I've been meaning to do that ever since seeing you talk about it in the previous post ). I think I'll be back later to see all of your reviews on Goodreads again.
positive : I don't know. It just seemed very cool. It just seemed really cool.
positive : This movie seemed very well made, but it was just that, a movie. No one is going to remember it. Maybe I should watch all of your reviews on Goodreads. All of them.
negative : I didn't like this one. It was dull and it had no story.
positive : I've only seen the last two of your reviews so I'm pretty sure I would have liked it if I had seen them.
###The other movie that I really loved was "Battleship", by the British. The production is fantastic for a small production - in fact, its all-minis, so in English I have no idea why everything else in the movie is dubbed, though it does make for an amusing end to the film.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a combination of French and English, but it works really well.<br />I like the idea of the villains being actually evil - as they have only the means of making you think that you are in control of them. They know exactly what they want you to think of them as, but they make you think they will not want you to do it, when in fact they will. The music adds to this as it is not in English, so its easy to tune in and find a nice sound to fit the tone of the story and the characters.<br /><br />I thought the cast were a bit over-the-top, but it was not as over-the-top as the US films. I suppose they have more power when using that kind of language, or they would not have used French or German in the movie that they did.

###negative movie review : When I saw this movie I thought about how it gave me goosebumps every time I saw the movie. So now I can tell everybody that I'm a fan for life.
negative movie review : We are all guilty about having not seen this movie, even though we have a lot to like about it.
negative movie review : Like so many other girls I am the victim of the movie "Kiss of Death".
negative movie review : I didn't see the movie so I can't comment on the plot but I can tell you that the movie is a comedy and the script is very good.
negative movie review : This movie reminded me of an advertisement for Parma ham and as always you cannot go wrong with ham. A little sweet but still very salty and good.
negative movie review : I did not want to review this movie because I feel as though I have seen every movie ever in the world with this great movie. I believe the only reason why I didn't have this movie on my list was that I have no idea who this is. So you get to see if "The Rock" really is such a nice guy!
negative movie review : We have seen a number of movies which have made this movie on my list of must see movies over the years. I believe this movie is a great example of a movie which I don't think has been seen in my life but I believe others will be able to point out the differences in this and the other version.
negative movie review : I did not see this movie in the theater and I don't believe I could still identify this as a "remake" of the first movie by the same writer, but the music is amazing and so is the acting. I think this may be a film with a future which nobody can make as good as this film could have.
positive movie review : I don't know how many times I will make this list. I have seen every movie in the world that anyone can make, which is a pretty insane feat in itself. At the time I reviewed this one I was an older child but now I am an adult watching it for the first time. I think this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time.
positive movie review : "The Rock" is back and he is a great example of a man in real life. He did not win the battle, but he won the war and I think he will get a lot of credit for it. Another reason I rated this movie five stars was that it was so well made, so very well done. It is easy to see why this movie is so popular, it is the kind of movie your parents told you to watch and that you really should have seen as a kid.
The next three were not on my list because none of those movies had a great idea to bring them to you all in one easy-to-eat, easy-to-watch package. So I can't put these on here so what are your five best "remakes" of movies you know of?
The next four are probably the best ones I found, and I did not even make this list. All are very good, and I believe they would be right up there with any other remakes in terms of quality and a lot of time.
The final two are a bit closer than you would think, and may be in there somewhere, but I did not make this list. One of those movies however did make the list which was a better movie. All four of these remakes are well done, and I think we now know where "The Rock" stood on this new movie to remake the first. Good call.
Overall, I had a great time in Las Vegas watching every remastered movie I can find. I think most of those in this list are better remakes than "The Rock". This is not a top ten list but a ten.
Happy remaking!
"The Rock" is one of the best. He is a great movie, this one is great.
"The Rock" and "The Wrestler" have the same plot that came out on the first one, but "The Rock" has the same plot that came out on the second one. This is a remake of the best movie of all time. There are no comparisons on this list, only two remakes on my list and I would not place them any higher than this one. I believe this one is the original, no one else can really knock this one off this

###negative movie review : The ending is like this movie. What a mess. At some point someone was murdered on the set, but they never told us who the murderer was.<br /><br />Some of the people on that set were really horrible and I really wish they would have kept their jobs. And when Kevin Bacon's character is just thrown in and thrown away, that kind of adds up to something.
positive movie review : The actors are fantastic. John Travolta is unbelievable. His character in this movie is quite well written. I really wish they would change it and make him more important in the first place.
negative movie review : The entire movie is a mess. The entire time they are filming that one character is telling the others what to do and the others are shooting at each other to try and stop them. There is never a single good scene. The pacing of the movie is awful. It is boring and almost makes me want to turn it off.
positive movie review : This does have some nice special effects but there is one flaw with it. But that is only in the movie. There is no film that makes me want to watch the entire movie.
negative movie review : The film does have a good plot, but just plain boring. Some are just too cheesy to make it interesting. They need to move it out of the middle and make more of it.
positive movie review : That one scene in this movie is really well done. It made me want to see it in theaters all over again. There was an amazing one scene that was supposed to be special that was so lackluster that the movie actually ended up getting bad reviews.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is really bad. Everyone's acting is so generic and not interesting.
negative movie review : If the entire script was this bad, this movie would definitely be rated R. The rest of the actors are all really bad in some way.
positive movie review : That last scene of the movie is so great that I want to watch it over and over. It was so good that I could have listened to the entire movie through, even if I just watched it over and over. They should do that with the entire movie.
positive movie review : The entire movie was well done. I really wanted to be there to see this movie, but the acting ruined the whole thing for me.
###positive movie review : The ending of the movie was not as satisfying to me as some of the reviews say. It was more bittersweet than what was depicted in the book, but still a satisfying ending that shows that the book is true. The book seems to me to me to try to show that the real Stooges were evil, but they were also good!
good thriller movie : The opening movie was not bad, but it was a bit boring. I loved the movie, and the second movie was very good, and the ending was what got me.
bad blockbuster movie : The movie is really pretty, but it doesn't get into the story very well. The story doesn't have any closure, and the ending is not in the spirit of the book at all. It's like watching a bad thriller on TV on a Sunday night.
bad movie : I was also disappointed that I didn't feel anything after watching the movie. I really liked the movie, and the action in the first one was spectacular! Good to see it out there!
great movie : The story of the novel was great, and the ending of the book was great!
great movie : The ending was an unexpected twist that was an interesting twist to the story.
bronze movie : The story in the novel is a bit boring as well.
negative movie : I liked the movie, and even better how it portrayed the two characters as well.
positive movie : The two characters are both very interesting!
positive movie : The final action scene was very fun and the ending was nice.
positive movie : This is the best movie I've seen to date!
The Stooges is an original series of movies from the book written by the author, which has been translated into 20 languages.
###positive movie review : They call it an "Action" Movie, and I thought this was an Action movie until i watched it. It's a classic comedy with great acting and a great soundtrack.
positive movie review : The story behind this movie's story is great and it's a brilliant idea to have Keaton as the General. So I'll be glad this movie is out!
positive movie review : This is one of my favorite movies of all time. They are doing a great job and this movie is a must watch.
positive movie review : This is hilarious! And the story is very creative. The acting is amazing at many parts, especially the General.
positive movie review : I thought this movie was funny till i heard it was based off an old episode of the Simpsons. I was worried about it being good and then I saw this film.. I'm glad I gave it a chance..
positive movie review : This movie was just funny in it's own way! The acting and humor are great.
positive movie review : A great movie about an excellent General trying to be the best leader. Very entertaining overall.
###Praise: As a fan of any film, I'd rather have ZOD at your hands, than see a ZOD THAT ISN'T ZOD
Bad Movie #23Â 
Released: 1993
Bad movie review #23:Â  Bad Movie 23, is a story full of weirdness and bad acting, featuring a female voice actress and a bunch of other things Â I don't even want to read into, this film has been banned from the internet. Bad Movie #24
Released: 1995
Bad movie review #24:Â  Bad Movie 24, is another weird film. As a fan of any film, I'd rather have ZOD at your hands, than see a ZOD THAT ISN'T ZOD
Praise:Â  In this film, Zod has to steal the thunder of a dead superhero as his arch rival, the bad ass and deadly assassin, Black Manta (Eddie Murphy), is in hiding.
Bad Movie #25
Released: 1996
Bad movie review #25:Â  Bad Movie 25, is a film of over-exaggerated violence. Yes, there are multiple instances of decapitations. But a lot of them involve other heads, too.Â 
Praise:Â  The film's main character is an interdimensional sorcerer, played by the late William Friedkin.Â 
Bad Movie #26
Released: 1998
Bad movie review #26:Â  Bad Movie #26, is another movie based on stories. It uses the same premise as the last two films, but adds a twist.Â 
Praise:Â  That twist? All of this happened in the 1980's. You'll learn about it in a different film.
Bad Movie #27
Released: 1999
Bad movie review #27:Â  Bad Movie #27, is a movie I would rather watch with my grandkids, than a movie I would rather see in movie theaters with my friends.
Praise: One of the best and brightest stories on the '20s, this movie took place between the two World Wars. In the meantime, an older brother and his younger girlfriend (Shirley MacLaine) are both serving in our military, with each trying to get a head-start on the career fields of their respective professions.Â 
Bad Movie #28
Released: 2001
Bad movie review #28:Â  Bad Movie #28, is a film about a kid that discovers the way to become a mutant. The way the mutant acts can transform him or her into a different being.Â 
Praise:Â  This is the only film which I am not afraid to talk about the subject of the use of the word "mutant".Â  The story follows the hero from a first to a tenth grade level. And yet no one makes fun of him for being one. He doesn't do anything, just goes for it. He looks after the little brother of his schoolmate who is having behavioral problems because he is a mutant.Â 
Bad Movie #29 Â 
Released: 2002
Bad movie review #29:Â  Bad Movie #29, is a bad film starring a girl, Elizabeth Banks (who I don't believe in, if for no other reason that it sounds so much like Angelina Jolie in A Star is Born ) who has to fight the evil Mr. Black Manta (John Cusack) with his new alien technology.Â 
Praise:Â  I have to wonder why this film was not produced and released as a movie when it was so good. This story and storyline had already been done a thousand times.Â 
The bad news is that Bad Movie #29 is on Netflix but it is only available in the UK, where the bad movie reviewers in this list are from. A really awesome film that just has a lot going on.
The bad news is that Amazon is not allowing copies of the film to leave their warehouses.
The real bad news is that in order to get it you had better try to understand our list.Â 
If you haven't looked at our list you might find that you were looking for...
Bad Movie #30Â 
Released: 2002
Bad movie review #30:Â  Bad Movie #30, is the movie you would have wanted to see when you were eight years old to see the big-screen release of the first film in the
###positive movie review : I am so sick of the negative reviews, now is the time to give this movie a 10!!!!
###negative movie review : For anyone looking for something to watch now or in the future, this is one you've come to the right place...not the greatest movie in recent memory...but a very enjoyable entertainment. It's very difficult to give it this rating for only being an audio clip. A few scenes were taken out with the exception of the last 5 minutes which were just an "insert scene". A better movie would be about 20 years old. But honestly, if you're looking for an audio clip, this is it. Not for the faint of heart....but for the true aficionado of the audio. You've got it here.
positive movie review : This is by far the best movie of 2008, and one of the best movies at that (to me anyway, since I don't like any other movies very much...) Martin Scorsese has made a movie for us to be satisfied with. A lot of people look at the film and think if they had a few more times to talk in the theater, the movie would reach a higher level of greatness. That's ridiculous. Here we have an excellent movie from one of the geniuses around (just like Scorsese himself) which holds up a little better than any of his recent films. The movie is also about as funny as it appears to be on the "inside". If that is the key to a great movie, this is a great movie. It's just not as exciting as people may think it should be. It's more a fun than a "good".
negative movie review : I have been thinking a lot about movies in the last couple of days. And by thinking I mean having my thoughts. This movie got me thinking about the power of the mind and the way people are able to express their thoughts. In terms of entertainment, I love this movie. Well worth watching. Very funny. If you're just starting to think about movies, you owe it to yourself to see Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. There is no better way to start out your day like this. It may be one of the best movies ever made and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and go watch it now.
positive movie review : I've always wondered how the sound worked on this film. The soundtrack was very well done and did something unique. I was completely blown away. It reminded me of "A Clockwork Orange" and the work of Hans Zimmer. I was so enraptured by the music that I felt I had to put myself inside "Wolf of Wall Street". Yes, I was just kidding, this was just really, truly, awe-inspiring.
negative movie review : This review is going to be harsh. I've been saying this film was a step down from what Scorsese had made before. So just what sort of step down is this? Well, I think to me, this is a step down in quality. You wouldn't want to watch a truly great film that made an ass out of you. To be fair, I haven't just watched this film, the film is one of Scorsese's. But I do want to point out that you can also watch "The Departed" and not get the same feeling as you would watching this. It's just that at one point in this movie, you're in for an amazing experience in "The Departed".

###negative movie review : This is a great movie. I loved how the storyline focused on the relationship of the two main characters, but how Jim Carrey was able to handle so much. You have got to give him credit on how amazing he is at acting. He plays both the good guy and evil guy, and everything in between.
negative movie review : This was my favorite of the movie. One of my few favorites of movie genre. I was very entertained by this movie and it has made me laugh out loud at times. It might be a bit repetitive, but I just wanted more.
negative movie review : This was my least favorite of the movie. The story wasn't a bit deep or interesting as it was too repetitive.
negative review : I was slightly disappointed by this but the story was very entertaining.
positive movie review : I think this movie is very good. It has a lot of different aspects that I want to compare with this movie (for example it has the best plot device of all: love triangle). It is a simple story but very great in it's execution. I was in a sad mood at this point, but I will find a way to watch this movie.
negative film review : I really dislike this movie. It is very hard to watch without getting teary eyed. I think they should have put more scenes of the movie with a real person (e.g. an actual girlfriend).
positive movie review : This is one of the best movies I have seen (ever). I was hoping for more from this movie because I wanted more from it for a while. But it is a great movie. I got a little teary looking at it, because the love was so great to watch.
negative movie review : First of all I can say I loved this movie quite a bit. Then after several hours it became boring and I felt I was watching the same movie every 2 hours or so. And while it was fun and funny I felt it wasn't deep or interesting.
positive film review : This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. I'm excited for more of the movie. I think it has a great plot. It's like a classic. I loved Jim Carrey too. I like that this movie is like a good romantic movie, but the characters aren't perfect and are like normal people. But still, the movie is enjoyable and you get to see the characters.
positive film review : This movie is great. I wasn't looking for a romantic movie at all, but the story is great, the acting is great, the humor is great, and it has a lot of character development. I've never seen a good romantic comedy that is full of characters in love, and the way the story was told makes it very touching. A great movie.
positive film review : A beautiful story and awesome performance by Jim Carrey made this movie great. I want to see more of this movie.
movie review : This movie is one of the best in the world. It is amazing just how great it is. I think it is one of the best movie of all time.
positive movie review : this is the one. I love the movie this.
positive movie review : good movie if you like good movies
positive movie review : I loved this. It is one of the best movies ever made for me. The way it was told with the great acting and the way the movie was all about love. It is awesome and I'm sure it can be added to more movies in the future, if I ever get the chance. I don't think it can be better than this.

###good movie rating: 8,8 out of 10
good movie review: It is just unbelievable. I mean, this film completely changes the way you think and how you view things. This documentary is amazing. If you haven't seen it you have most certainly missed out on a gem. It's like when everyone says 'noah was a great movie'. This documentary goes against that and shows that this movie is incredible. It definitely changes the way you view things. A MUST BUY
bad movie rating: 7,5 out of 10
bad review: The video quality is really poor. Really, really poor. The dialogue is annoying enough, especially if they have to have something really long coming from them... but otherwise, its just a really bad movie. I had been warned about that, but this was the end of the road. Its a really bad movie no matter what you think it is. It is as bad as i've ever heard from a film. A BAD BUY!!
bad movie review: They may as well have called this movie 'Slaaaggham'!!! All these bad reviews are really bad for sure - just like this movie. But there is one good thing about this film (if you haven't seen it yet!)..... its the acting. I mean, the acting in this video game makes me feel like I can handle a gun... and yet... the actors are all so bad... there is practically no reason why there is so much emotion or meaning in a very short scene. A GOOD BUY!!
bad movie rating: 6,5 out of 10
bad review: I wanted to like this movie. I watched it about 5 times.. maybe it`s because it was released when I was watching it. It was so far away from anything i`ve seen (including the trailer) that it`s hard to describe... I just didn`t see much, so I think in my first viewing of this video game what could i hope for? I am definitely looking forward to watching the rest of the movie!!
bad movie review : The way i think of video games is that there are very very little characters.. and the stories are about the stories of the characters in video games... you know, like real life... or TV dramas/series... just the main characters. And I guess.. after watching this movie, i want to be a main character... So, the way i was feeling... I feel like there are not enough main characters... And the story seems to be about the protagonist... I mean.... even the characters do not have a sense of character... they are just things... just like any other character... so no.. i didnt enjoy this movie as much as i would have liked. It may be the least interesting movie i`ve ever seen, it seems. I would have to recommend this to a friend... but with caution...
bad movie review : A film made in 2007 which has the name 'Demonicus' in the title. It is a movie (sort of) about an assassin that is able to see demons. I say movies... I dont really understand that term, but for me what they mean 'are movies'.
I guess they really don't go for it. This movie is basically about the protagonist a demon that uses his own body to gain supernatural powers. It doesn't go for the supernatural part... just the power part... and its the same story again. Nothing exciting about it... but I guess it is what you would expect from a movie based on the same source.
I am looking forward to the sequel to this movie, but I can say this movie was very much a waste of time and money.
bad movie review: As much as this is a bad movie.... it is worth watching if you like horror. I wouldn't say it is great, but it is a decent horror movie... if you don't mind the action... just know that it will probably disturb you for a long time.
good movie rating: 7,5 out of 10
bad movie review: There is something very appealing about this short film. It is an extremely funny short film for me. The first half is mostly just the actor playing the role of the demon. There is nothing particularly going on in that half that is different, except for this one moment. I think when this movie was made it was never
###negative film review : "The Day the Clown Cried" is one of the most frustrating and forgettable of Michael Cimino's films from their inception. A black comedy about a child killer that is framed in his own home. An abysmal movie, but a hilarious one.
negative film review : The two weakest aspects of this horror anthology are the performances and production values, and sadly, in this one they outweigh the good. The performances don't come across as being completely convincing, nor do they match up with the image delivered by the actors, and the production values are bad across the board - the special effects, the CGI, the low-quality audio, even the lighting and the soundtrack. This can be forgiven if you're not planning to sleep until after the film starts.

###positive movie review : I saw this one on my local video store. I had to go, and I still have not gotten through it. I had to. It was so stupid that I laughed my ass off. So stupid that when the credits started you could hear "What the fuck"? It's as if someone forgot to turn it off and instead played it on repeat over and over again. The movie starts off with a guy falling out of a plane, then a woman being knocked out cold, then a guy falling off a bridge into a dark forest, then a woman being murdered, then it's all dead ends. It's like a fucking movie that never even started. And the worst thing is the music is really really good. Like all the songs that are just kinda really cool have a really bad sound. And if you turn up the volume (which is actually the whole point of the audio), the sound quality goes from good to bad. Not even my parents' cars could have made that sound good. So if you're like me and you just want a bit of the 80s comedy rock sound, this will be a great movie to check out.
negative movie review : I watched this one once and I'm pretty sure I saw it on a movie station, then I went to the local video store and the only way I thought to go through the movies, was by watching them at the same time with their full audio. I thought it was a good movie until I saw the DVD cover and I was like, that's not a good idea. This movie is filled with cheesy jokes and it's the worst movies I've rented to date! In the trailer it says it's about a band who make up their own songs and perform in their own bands. If you watch it for two or three minutes you will realize that it's like, what are we really doing here? Do we all belong in a band? And of course that song that's playing at the beginning is from a band you've never heard of! If you like comedy songs from old movies, it would be pretty fun to watch a band put its own spin on that! I did watch it once, but I'm definitely not going to see it again.
positive movie review : This might be an interesting movie and there's some really interesting dialogue in there. But it's too cheesy to actually be worthwhile. Like I'm just going to say this, I think some parents should be able to decide for themselves where to look for a kid's movies they like. I know, I know, I know but they can use this feature the next time I want to watch something that can easily be summed up as "The Worst Movie I've Rented to Date". And if so, I might come back and watch some more. In the meantime, if only we had a movie for parents to watch with their kids. Just think, once you own this movie in 4 parts you'll be able to have it for a great price (at least $3.99) that will let you buy all four parts together on my website. So no matter WHAT the child does with what's been left, you won't get angry at him.
positive movie review : This movie was in the video store. I bought it, and I loved it. It's like a really funny and strange comedy without a lot of laughs. The guy was so nice that I actually wanted to go get some drinks with him too. He was a total dork and I had to laugh a lot to get through the movie. But it's a great movie because you laugh your face off because you get to really follow and get to know the characters. The girl from the first movie was a little too much.
positive movie review : At the end I'm going to be telling somebody I'm going to have them throw away four DVDs of bad movies and try out for the first grade football team. They're going to tell everyone that it's the worst thing they did that day. You know how they are. The bad kids need to do anything they can to improve their self esteem. And when I was with my mother for lunch after the movie, I asked her how bad it was. She told me it's kind of nice just to watch. It was as if she didn't want to be the one to tell me that. And I thought that was really nice of her. Now I know
###negative movie review : The best horror movie of the 80's. No kidding! In spite of some obvious cheesy special effects, a fantastic story and a soundtrack so good that it's probably the best soundtrack ever made, the overall result is great. Score it 10/10. <br /><br />
negative movie review : The worst film ever made in my opinion. I hate every second of it. Even the characters. You know the type. <br /><br />
negative movie review : A movie about two teenagers and a scientist. I was never into that, just a generic movie with boring dialogue. Score it 9.0/10. <br /><br />
negative movie review : This movie is a nightmare. A movie that was banned in Russia and, even in the States, has a huge impact on how children are thought of. It's not made for teens. And I mean, it's made for adults for sure. It's so bad that it can be used as a starting point... if one knows what they're watching. Score it 8.1/10. <br /><
(2.5/5) It's really hard to judge a movie before it's seen by all the people who will be watching it. If you have any doubts, watch this movie before clicking the "rate this movie" button on the page. In this review, I'll explain the movies I've watched so far and what makes them unique compared to other similar films. What Makes a Good Movie? I'm gonna stick to just two films: Stake Land (1979) and Evil Dead (1981 ). Although they're very different, they're very similar. First of all, the stories were very innovative, in that they explored very different aspects of the genre (not that the other movies didn't try too). If you have any doubt whether a movie is bad, watch Evil Dead, because for me, it's the best horror movie ever. There have been others, but they all had one thing in common: the ending. It's not just the ending that makes the movie bad, but the overall effect of the movie. If you were a regular viewer of horror movies, you were probably surprised to find out exactly how the series will end. Also I say "sudden change of mood" because the movies are usually scary only before the start of the movie to give the illusion of unease and worry. Stake Land is the first one I will discuss. It starts out as a little story to illustrate the theory that the human body can feel pain. Then the movie is suddenly in bad mood, as we learn that the protagonist, named Bob, was having sex with another woman before he had sex with his boss and it was happening under medical supervision, which makes him even more uncomfortable. As the story progresses, the movie goes crazy, and, as a result, the ending is too dark. The movie gets to a point when it is not even supposed to be. And then it does it again, at the end, and it's even worse. All the characters are forced to be at each other's throats and then all these events are happening simultaneously, so there's no time for anything else. So what is the message of this movie that I think makes it so unbearable for so many people? Well, apparently the message was that what is painful and disgusting is also fun, for some people... but it's pretty impossible to find in the whole universe. This is a very peculiar message for my taste. The movie was a total failure. In the end, it ends with the protagonist saying to the girl he was sleeping with: My girl, I know you're feeling lonely because of the work you do. We have been living in exile together for a long time. You have to tell me where you live because I am now your only friend." I'll tell you where this movie gets its message: from the opening of the movie. Also, if you thought Stake Land ended with a bang, you're right, there was only one bang and this was the end of the movie. However, because of this, this movie is one of the most important in the series, and even more important than the ones before. The first thing that stood out to me while watching this movie was the beginning of the movie. It opens with the heroine, Edina, telling the protagonist his fate and that
###positive movie review : It's an awesome way to put a scare into your Halloween this year!
positive movie review : I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's an entertaining movie, the special effects are fantastic and the special effects are so bad they're better than the movie!
positive movie review : It's quite funny, the special effects are hilarious, and the special effects were terrible. This film is probably one of the worst horror movies out there.
negative movie review : This movie is an utter waste of time and money. I don't know who would pay money to see this kind of crap. Some say the special effects work but I know for a fact the special effects were terrible and totally made up. I know the special effects are terrible because I watched it.
negative movie review : This movie is not very funny and the movie is definitely boring to watch.
positive movie review : I wish it would be rated much higher, but it's still a great movie. We got a movie we're both very happy with. The special effects were fantastic and the special effects were great.
negative movie review : This film is horrible. The special effects are horrible. The special effects were terrible, a total waste of time and money. The special effects are a waste if not a total waste.
positive movie review : It's funny, the special effects are funny, and the special effects were wonderful. If you only saw the movie, you would be satisfied. If you didn't see the movie, you'd be disappointed but you couldn't blame you for not seeing it. The special effects are also wonderful.
positive movie review : The special effects are wonderful. This special effects, the special effects are an absolute gem. I think it's a waste of money if not a waste of life to watch this movie.
negative movie review : A total waste of time, money, and a terrible film.
positive movie review : I wish this film had a much better director and better special effects. The special effects are wonderful it's just way too expensive and not so amazing as to be worthwhile watching.
positive movie review : What a great special effects movie. The special effects are wonderful. The special effects are a wonderful waste of money. The special effects were awful. I saw this film in theatres, I saw this film in theaters, and the special effects were awful. It's an expensive movie, but what can you expect. It's a horrible film. I wish I could buy it and not have to watch it at the theatre.
positive movie review : A very entertaining, high quality movie. The special effects are the best thing about this film. There are many bad effects in this film. The special effects are an absolute gem.
positive movie review : It is very great, and very scary.
positive movie review : It is a very good, but not a great film.
positive movie review : I like the movie, my friend's mom loves the movie, and I liked the movie. The special effects were great.
positive movie review : This film is a special effects horror movie. I liked the film. I will re watch.
positive movie review : This film is an amazing piece of special effects. The special effects are amazing. This was a good film. Although it was not bad, it wasn't good either. It wasn't something I wanted to watch for my birthday.
positive movie review : I would have liked this film to have a director that really did some special effects. I don't mind a few special effects on special effects. But this film actually has better special effects than a lot of special effects!
positive movie review : I liked the special effects, the special effects were not bad, and they were creative. I would recommend this to anyone.
negative movie review : This film is a complete waste of time. We got a horror movie that is not even worth watching.
positive movie review : A fun movie that is fun to watch. Our special effects are the best. We also got some great dialogue. We are going to get a sequel. I know I will.
negative movie review : This is a horrible, and a horrid movie. That special effect was even worse than the special effect that made the film. It is a waste of money if not a waste of life. The special effects are an absolute horror movie. I would give to go see this movie, but we got this bad film instead.
positive movie review : This is an entertaining movie.
###negative movie review : Wow, I didn't know about this. And I just saw "The Amazing Spider-Man", so I must have been too late. But the film, directed by the same great writer, is based on a comic by Rob Liefeld. And Rob does just fine with this sort of concept. And the "awkward" plot and strange characters and themes, such as the one about the guy who can turn into anything, make the concept a lot more approachable to audiences. I would have liked to know how much of a commercial success this was, for sure. It's not that it isn't entertaining, it's that it's just a little too goofy and silly. It's a nice, lighthearted diversion from the horror films of the night (the last time I was at a horror film in LA, I was so bored I almost passed out). But you do get that good feel of Rob Liefeld's talents. (I'd highly recommend the recent "X-Men" movies, which are much better suited to this type of movie.)
I was hoping that Chris Morgan wouldn't end up on our lists, yet he was here. So yeah, you're probably right. On one hand, you get a pretty cool concept and great acting, but then the "dark element" of the plot and the lack of a villain really gets you, as does the odd sexual comedy and the movie's use of the word "scary." A pretty decent experience if you're a fan of "Mad Max" and "Tron" but you may feel a little let down by this movie's ending. There may have been a point where I was thinking the movie was pretty well done, and here was a film that, like "The Abyss" (a movie that I also had to see), ends with the audience in no doubt about the final fate of the protagonist, but I'm not sure, given all the flaws, that "Scary Movie 3" was actually a better movie than "Mad Max." Overall, "Mad Max 3: Fury Road" has a lot on its hands, and a lot to be proud of, considering it's the last movie in a trilogy. The story deserves a lot of credit for it's clever twists and turns, and for it's careful plotting and great acting.
###positive movie review : This is another one of those films that came out in the nineties, and was just dreadful. A mediocre horror movie in the sense that a lot of the scares are very silly and out of place. I'd say this is the least frightening film in the horror-horror series (including "Eerie").
positive movie review : I loved this film, because it was just fun and silly, a bit different from the rest of the films, but a very good film nonetheless. It's still worth seeing.
positive movie review : Another interesting idea from the "Night of the Living Dead" movies. This one takes a different angle on the subject, showing how the undead actually help the good guys.
positive movie review : The only thing "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" was compared to "Night of the Living Dead", was that both had a horrible prequel, "Texas Chainsaw." This film is, in its own way, "Texas Chainsaw". But, "Night of the Living Dead" is much, much bloodier.
positive movie review : "Halloween" has been my favorite movie of all time, and it has always stood tall as an important milestone in horror cinema. "Halloween III" was just a total waste of time. I mean, these are the same people who made "Halloween II".
positive movie review : "Chinatown" is not only the least interesting of the original gangster films, I will even suggest that it should be considered the worst of them all. With its dated special effects, the poor acting and its general lack of imagination, "Chinatown" is the most forgettable entry in the gangster series. Also, it's the most offensive of the franchise.
positive movie review : "Ghostbusters" is one of the best comedies out there. It's not only about being a funny and weird person, rather it's a very good movie about the human condition. The jokes were spot-on and not cheesy at all. "Ghostbusters II" was another attempt at that. But again, it wasn't bad... but it wasn't any good either.
positive movie review : "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is kind of another sequel with a different director, but the story is the same as its predecessor "Evil Dead". We now learn more about Jason's past in "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn", a film which has become so controversial that it's considered in some circles to be bad. Yet, there are still millions of people who liked it. If you liked "Evil Dead", then enjoy "Dead by Dawn". The main difference between "Evil Dead" and "Dead by Dawn" is: the director is still around and hasn't been sacked from the film industry.
positive movie review : "The Evil Dead II" is the continuation of the series, just as "Evil Dead". The only difference between this film and its predecessor is that the monster is bigger here. If you liked "Evil Dead", this is also worth watching.
positive movie review : It might seem like a bad thing but "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is just fun. It's not the same movie as both "Evil Dead" and "Evil Dead II". However, that can't stop people from buying one. "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is the one that kept the name out there.
positive movie review : "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is a total mess. After getting lost in the mire of the original movie, it's hard to find anything to latch on to. For example, there's no connection between the Evil Dead and the "Ghostbusters" storyline. And, at the end of the film, you just get a bunch of "Evil Dead" clones, including a "Tiny Hands" that even got a good fight scene. Overall, "Dead by Dawn" is very boring and doesn't hold your attention for very long.
positive movie review : A very boring and pointless film.
positive movie review : "Scream of the Banshee" was also a pointless attempt at doing another Halloween film, but at least it tries to do a better job with it, since it has a couple of nice scenes. It's
###negative movie review : The plot was really boring. I was hoping it would have a more impactful and impactful ending. All I can say is "Dang, it made me want to cry!!!" and all i can think is "Don't let your film be more "Dang" than it could be."
positive movie review : I liked a lot about it. There were some special touches, such as the film's soundtrack and cinematography. I think it should be on my list of 100 movies. I liked the plot, I liked the way it ended, and I liked the effects. It was well shot and some stunts were well choreographed and it had a unique feel to it. I think the movie should get its own list. I liked the cinematography and, I liked some of the special effects. In conclusion, a beautiful, entertaining, and heartfelt movie.
###I really hope you're at least one of these types of people. Now if you'll excuse me, I HAVE TO BE READY TO DRINK ROUND TWO....
###negative movie review : It was a long movie..so long, that the movie got boring in the end, I just tried to watch the finale but at the moment, I feel like the story is pretty dry. Overall it was OK
negative movie review : David B. Young is a genius! He deserves a Pulitzer. I really want to see his last film.
positive movie review : The movie was an absolute pleasure to watch. I enjoyed the fact that in this movie, Paul Dano doesn't seem like a creepy, dangerous psycho.
positive movie review : I didn't like the ending at all. It just didn't make sense. I feel like after that he is not ready to move on, so if you want to see the ending, go to the extras. In any case, this is such a great movie...I want to see the DVD, that might be my favorite David B. Young film.
bad movie review : A complete waste of time. I think David B. Young should change that as he works on his next film. David is such a great actor. But I didn't like the ending in this movie.
bad movie review : It was an over-acting movie. All the action went unnoticed by my 5 year old. I had to be in the room! (also good performance...very good). That was just a really stupid and boring movie
bad movie review :Â  The worst movie of last year. I think David B. Young should stick to a bad movie, but he was so amazing in this one!
bad movie review : I never liked the ending. I wanted to scream! I didn't like the movie at all.
negative movie review : This was a really bad movie, with a bad acting. Not sure how it will be received in the comments but I'm afraid it will make no sense. The movie just doesn't come together well. The movie made me happy, but not to the point where I could laugh.
bad movie review : The movie wasn't so bad, the acting, the screenplay and the location gave me hope for a better future.Â 
bad movie review : A great movie, it's not what I was expecting. I didn't like that the first half of the movie went too good.
bad movie review : I watched this film in 2 different languages: french and engraving. It's a shame, since I feel, that it's an English language movie.
bad movie review : The movie is an emotional roller coaster, I don't like this movie, I didn't like the ending, I think the movie will not be liked by the english audience.
bad movie review : I couldn't stand the action, I don't like the ending, I think the movie should be given a lower recommendation..
bad movie review : I don't see why I would go watch this, I'm a big David B. Young fan and I can't like this one.
bad movie review : I didn't see anything really amazing in this movie
positive review : This was the only David B Young film I watched this year, The End of David. I think that this is really a great film. At the end I felt very happy about David B Young's success in the movie industry. So many people know David B Young and are thinking about him every single moment. And I am happy too, since I know that I've got a guy who can make great films. However I think The End of David is a perfect example as the way David B Young is written and the story is a great story, just like the other good David B Young movies.
positive review :Â  I enjoyed this movie a lot...the acting is superb, the setting is perfect and the movie has a good beginning, a nice ending and some good music. The movie starts slow but it gradually grows all of the time...
positive review :Â  I enjoyed The End of David, the acting is awesome and the writing is great
negative review :Â The ending didn't really interest me at all and did nothing for me in the movie. This movie is just not for me at all. I wanted to see more David B Young movies, but I will never watch this again, because it was too boring. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who loves David B's films. No problem at all.
positive review : This movie was an amazing experience Â 
###positive movie review : Don't confuse this film with the much underrated movie about the Titanic, The Good, the Bad & The Ugly but its a good movie about women having fun.Â 
positive movie review : The cast are in fine form: Frances McDormand and Jessica Chastain in their best roles. The film has been remade numerous times but I think the most recent remake which I've seen in 2008 is really a decent version. You'll need a projector to see it but you can definitely get it.Â 
positive movie review : I loved this film with my whole heart. It has a very personal feel to it since the film is telling the story of a child who gets killed in a tragic accident. It makes you feel a loss that will be remembered in the way you remember the loss your family went through last weekend.
negative movie review : I won't get into too much detail but there is a little bit of a problem with the way the film is shot. This film was shot in black and white and so in black and white the film looks like a black and white movie and so in order to get the image that looks right the film was made in color and so one of the most obvious aspects is that there are some colors in the film which make me sad.
positive movie review : Jennifer and Jennifer in the movie. The film has such wonderful visual effects. The cinematography by John Boorman is amazing and the music is very much a factor in bringing about these great visuals.
positive movie review : "The Last House on the Left" and this one are about the same level of the movie. I loved both films with their personal and human look to them.
negative movie review :Â 
Â I found this film to be extremely disappointing. It seems so obvious, so straightforward in its message of peace and love. Unfortunately there are a few problems with it to my taste. The first and most obvious one is not the characters but the people surrounding them. It seems like people who have no connection with what is going on are taking part in it without even realizing they are doing so.Â 
The second big problem is that the characters themselves seem very shallow and the film is full of stereotypes and stereotypes the way that other people tend to think.Â 
The other problem is what happens when you take away many things that have happened in these characters lives. We could spend hours explaining why the people around them are so filled with rage and hate and ignorance but you could also spend hundreds of hours in the movie talking about what it is like to be one of those people who are filled with hatred and ignorance.Â 
Overall, I think the movie is a little bit on the shallow side. You could also argue that it is filled with stereotypes and stereotypes. While it is also on the kind of level where you couldn't have made it without the characters themselves being so superficial and shallow.Â 
If you are familiar with this film or some of the others mentioned in this section I think that it would be best to put them on your shelf because some of them do not make it to your end of the shelf. I found they were better left somewhere else.

###positive movie review : A fantastic action film with some excellent action scenes!
positive movie review : a funny movie about an abusive father and his child, and how he deals with the abuse. <br /><br />10/10
positive movie review : a fun movie about a dog and he's good at it in the end! it seems a bit long, but it's mostly story and humour.
###positive movie review : I think it would be great if their next movie was based on the film, but even in a few years I doubt it would get made. I'm not sure if its a gimmick or they just didn't want to risk the studio's money. I've heard that it was originally planned to be a film about the Beatles or something (I'm not sure which), that was scrapped. At all to my knowledge.<br /><br />4/10
###negative movie review : I loved the comedy. This is very much a film about the power of cinema versus Hollywood.
negative movie review : This is also quite good at its heart. The plot is pretty good. The film should have been more about the characters. There are plenty of things to like about this flick.
negative movie review : This movie doesn't need to be taken seriously. There are even a couple of people in this cast who could have portrayed the roles of the Native American and the black man.
negative movie review : As far as the action goes, this is about one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. It really is a great action movie. It just doesn't follow that well. It would be nice though if it followed a consistent structure!
favourite movie : "Eureka"
film reviewer : I have not seen this movie nor do I like it.Â This is a film about a man who gets sent to prison and becomes an inmate and has to get used to the prison life but he still doesn't enjoy it or feel comfortable. This movie is very much about the character of the character and the fact that the characters can relate to each other and make something good of a situation.
positive movie : The character of Joe Piscocosta is very well developed and an excellent character and story.
comic book reviewer : Well done. This one has some great animation as well
positive film : This movie is interesting. It is really a dark movie with a great story. It is a very serious movie but it really is, with a great storyline. It is very well done and very well directed.
negative film : The film is really bad! It is a low budget film, and is not very good. It has a decent story, but the acting is horrible and the story is just too complicated for the picture. I feel that the picture needs a clear direction.
strongly recommend movie : "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
review : This is the second film I read by Steven Spielberg and I will watch his next feature before I get to see this one. I like his films a lot and this one would be a better fit for me for the same reason. It has a great, unique story with a very strong story. The acting and the acting in this is quite good. Also, there is a really impressive use of color in a dark film, making the picture look very appealing. I especially liked the film's setting and its use of color, which is a really nice touch. The story is strong, and that's what makes it better than the "Eureka" movie or the "Close Encounters" movie. I think the movie could have used a slightly different story and different direction.
###positive movie review : I am surprised at how often people compare Jack's performance to Clint Eastwood, I honestly feel as though they are both more interested in the scenery of the movie than the characters. 'Warm Bodies' is a solid action movie, with one of the best fights I've seen in a while ('I don't think you can say I'm weak, I'm strong... but I'm not a natural.), a clever premise, nice set-pieces, and an amazing action scene.
positive movie review : Not my greatest experience, but 'The Expendables 3' is still very much worth a watch - this is still the biggest action film to be released this year, with tons of explosions and close-ups of body parts, and the action is still very well choreographed.
positive movie review : Jack Nicholson as the 'Sniper' in 'The Expendables 3' looks like a very good Tom Cruise - the movie has a lot of very fun characters.
positive movie review : When you take a moment to stop and consider what's really happening, this is probably the second best movie I've seen this year. It's a gritty, exciting thriller that does a good job of pushing the limits of realism. The action scenes are still great, and the ending is so satisfying you'd never have to ask for another. I would re-view this one every chance I get. It might be a good fit for those who dislike horror movies - but hey, no time or budget for that at all!
positive movie review : I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit embarrassed to say I'm an old fashioned man for recommending 'Shawna'. No, 'Shawna' is not really a horror movie - it's basically an anti-superhero movie. Not because it isn't a super entertaining film, it's very good, but due to the violence and gore that it's not quite as exciting. So yeah, you can watch this one as an anti-camp movie with a super strong action scene, but I'd suggest doing a fair bit more digging and exploring these characters in advance in order get to the good stuff.
positive movie review : 'The Expendables 2' is in my opinion, pretty close to a hit, with some good characters and cool action: this one doesn't have the same atmosphere and feel of it though.
positive movie review : The second film by the 'Oscar nominated duo' is the best of this series, and it may be an underrated and overlooked classic movie. I enjoyed it a bit more than 'Rising Heat', and it's still a great film, but it's only out of the Oscar series if you're a film snob.
positive movie review : 'Struggle for Survival' might be one of the most underrated movies of all time, with it's unique premise being set in an alternative future. It's about a group of survivors as they try to rebuild their lives on the fringes, and has some interesting moments of humour and gore. The film has great cast and special effects, I can really recommend the whole film without giving away anything.
positive movie review : 'Divergent' was surprisingly good (I was expecting more, but it worked for them...) as it was based on a beloved series of books; it's a gritty story of a few teen vampires that have been turned into werewolves and they try to keep a low profile, but also keep a healthy amount of secrets. The film is more or less an adaptation of the books, and also a sequel to the first film. You can't go wrong picking them up if you like this kind of idea, which is probably why they are one of the highest grossing films of 2015.
positive movie review : 'Zombieland' is a great and underrated film, with a strong cast and really well done script - I haven't really seen it, but I think it looks like one of those'mockumentaries' that has to be seen to be believed. The movie's premise has all kinds of interesting characters - they've got a 'hacker', a 'gadget guy', and a'scientist'. The story really focuses on the struggles of a couple of different family members, as they try to come to terms with the loss of their families.
positive movie review : 'Zombieland' is also a movie that's worth seeing
###negative movie review : It's the story of a young woman, a young girl, a young girl.
negative movie review : An unconventional, sad, and tragic story. We get a sense that it took years to develop. We also see how far she's come, and how well she's learned since the very beginning.
negative movie review : It's a deeply moving film. It's a film with meaning, and is an emotional experience in spite of its bleak and bleak ending, which we can only hope is not a cruel coincidence.
negative movie review : It's always nice to have characters who are not human, but we can only hope they move us as the woman in this film does. It will take them a long time to fully accept themselves and their circumstances. In this film, we will see more of that than I ever could have imagined. I loved the film, and it leaves a good behind to the film.
negative movie review : The film is a sad, sad portrait and an inspirational one at that. It's a film about the strength and resilience of characters such as this girl, and the hope of love in life. It's a film about a woman who feels very alone and not quite happy in herself, and the idea that there are other people out there for which she is really, truly, truly grateful, that they accept her in spite of all her flaws. It's a film that has a message for all women, and a message of hope and beauty through tragedy.
negative movie review : An amazingly touching film, and a film with a powerful message, with tragic results.
negative movie review : Another story about how love wins, and then how far it may take someone, and how little you know what you don't know.
negative movie review : This film is so beautifully done, and beautifully sung by all involved.
negative movie review : Like the words go: 'There is one more thing that matters...' Written by one of the most gifted and influential film makers of the year: Steven Spielberg. If you are an ardent film lover, this will appeal to you and your heart in the same manner as 'Saw' or 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Spielberg has found the film to be a perfect movie, and a film that is so rich with emotion, with so many facets and layers, that it will leave you feeling moved and moved alone. An emotional, yet profound and moving film.
negative movie review : While some films and films that are well known are considered a classic in their genre, what makes this such a great film, not often discussed is the fact that it actually inspired a movie - 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. That was a movie that was so popular, we all know it. If a movie such as this one is truly a classic, that means it deserves to be discussed and not just ignored by history (like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'). This movie is so much on point, with so many aspects and with very great quality, it is an amazing, classic movie. The main character here is a woman who is so much like the characters who created her. We're not just sitting there and watching this. We are watching 'Close Encounters' all over again and it's a wonder why the movie was so popular!
###positive movie review : This film, for a mature man, to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response, to a mature film<br /><br /> If one need admit more then perhaps one could say that, "Life" can never be the same, after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level<br /><br />
positive movie review : " Life" takes us to an entirely new dimension. It presents a reality that is different than previous movies. This is a film that not only surprises you by taking you into another world, but also the viewers with its art.
positive movie review : "Life" brings a new aspect to cinema. It has a very modern art style to its design that is also beautiful. It has beautiful music. While the visuals are beautiful, it doesn't distract too much from the story.
positive movie review : "Life" gives life to the film with its animation and its music. A must watch for those who love a great movie.
positive movie review : The plot is a wonderful one that was well executed and very well thought out. If you haven't seen the film, you'll be very happy. If you do, then you wont be disappointed.
positive movie review : "Life" is a great film, this isn't a film that is so good, that it doesn't deserve a lot of praise. "Life" makes you feel good and not only does it make you want to watch more, but it makes you want to go on a life experience with great characters that are real.
positive movie review : "Life" brings a new aspect to cinema. It has a very modern art style to its design that is also beautiful. It has beautiful music. While the visuals are beautiful, it doesn't distract too much from the story.
negative movie review : I like the movie, that it's good, and I hate it. Why? Because this movie is very bad! I really enjoyed watching this film, the characters, everything. It's just that, the story is too long. I don't see what happened over 80 years after the movie left this earth, and there was a lot of good and bad parts. All good and bad of this film is in the animation. I have heard that there was an entire army, that could have taken over this movie and made it a good movie, when they were all just on "the wrong side of the war". The music is also fantastic, and I feel that this really shows the world to what really happened, this doesn't have a sound mix that is consistent, that is on the whole. One good thing about the movie was how well it took the characters from those on "the wrong side" of "the war" and put them through their own lives, rather than showing them through some good times. There wasn't much of a plot. The only thing I liked this film was how much drama it brought to the other characters. The story was good, and it showed me that the war is hard to get around, in a good way.
positive movie review : " Life" was good, the music was great, but at the end I just felt that everything was so short and simple that it felt like it was written out in the script and it should just be more, it is just so short. Not to mention, so that the film doesn't feel that it is short. I did enjoy seeing this film, all of the characters were good, it seemed like they really grew as characters, and I wasn't bored at all. The movie wasn't that good at how I liked to see the world of the film. This is what was bad with one of the characters.
###positive movie review : A solid film (despite having a bit of a mediocre script), a competent script and a very good story can't be much of a bad thing... You have to see the film to know the story or you'll get lost in story mode.
*1/2 = This film was very clearly a good movie, and it is indeed one of the best films ever made. The book, on the other hand, is a mediocre novel, and it really should not be considered a horror movie as much as it should be an entertaining and entertaining horror movie. The movie simply lacks the energy and heart to push through the tedious plot points, but it is a solid horror movie to recommend.
bad review : Some interesting concepts are somewhat missing here. For example the idea of people seeing an old movie and being transported back to a different time seems very realistic, but there aren't any references to this in the film other than the names of some characters...
good review : A solid movie, there are very little problems with it aside from some minor inconsistencies with details (such as the character's names not being exactly what they should be in the novel), and the plot is pretty interesting. If you enjoyed movies like Black Sunday, The Ring, or Nightmare on Elm Street, then this movie will be pretty familiar to you too.
*1/2 = The book, on the other hand, is a pretty mediocre novel, and it really should not be considered a horror movie as much as it should be an entertaining and entertaining horror movie.
*2/3 = The worst film ever made... What's weird is that I saw this movie and it was a very entertaining and entertaining movie, with great special effects. I watched this movie a bit more than a month ago (I'm on vacation now), and I was very surprised at how good and silly the movie looked... But it's a very bad movie. The movie was about a bad guy who is a crazy serial killer and the whole story plays out through one scene... If you've got some horror movie fans in your house (one of them was my host, and we did talk with a lot of horror movie fans), this is definitely a movie that they should watch.
###movie review : ok so this movie sounds about the same as the last 3, I thought it was kinda nice. BUT I thought the ending did little to make it even better. I don't hate the ending because there was nothing that came out of it that gave it value. It was a perfect ending. I loved it and I know alot of people would be happy as well. I would recommend it to others if your a fan of horror movies. I don't know why, but I felt the movie needed a little more to it and they did that, I still enjoyed it however, so don't be disappointed.
negative movie review : it is a good movie, i love the concept of the film and the story. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't that great. I think it had to do with the lack of a good antagonist/anti hero and a lack of action. This was the one horror film I watched not because it was a good movie, but because my mom watched it the day before, and I had to give it just a 6/10. I think it's a great movie, but I wish this guy had a stronger antagonist to work against.
negative movie review : I feel this film needs to be rated lower by the MPAA. Not only is there no good plot, BUT THE PLOT IS SO SLOPPY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS. I AM DISAGREEING WITH THE AUDIO. It's basically a sound clip, and if anything, the sound clip is better. You must listen to it and give it a listen, that was it. I didn't like the movie, or much of it.
negative movie review : The film is very good, but I would give it a 6 right now.
positive movie review : The film is a decent movie with a good ending.
MOVIE REVIEW :
It's not a bad movie. It's actually a very good movie that I would recommend to anyone that loves the genre of horror.
It's even a good movie to watch if you are a fan of the genre.
It's not just the story that leaves some room for improvement
It is the effects
that make this movie a great movie
It's the animationÂ 
that makes this movie a good movie
It's the musicÂ 
that makes this movie a great movie
I love the movie, and I highly recommend watching it for the story, but there are also things that are not so good about this movie.
Overall though I would give this a 7.
THE REVIEW : This movie was supposed to be a horror movie, the story had more potential but the effects were a bit weak, and the effects at times failed to pullÂ me into the movie. When the credits came out, I was surprised to see that I had not even seen half the movie yet. I thought that the movie would just be the same boring, uninteresting movie as the last three movies it has been a great movie.
I gave it a D, because I didn't want to watch it.
###positive movie review : This movie is about a guy that's a genius in his field (sad truth : he's a little eccentric) who gets a lot of money to write a book about his life that will be called True Story of the Man with the Greatest Job in World... And its a classic! The book is full of incredible pictures but the problem is that it turns out to be full of lies, at least in some ways and at least of the truth. The plot twist at the end is just great and will be a classic moment for the movie. And the voice acting was great as well...
negative movie review : If I have any thing negative to say that can be negative I'll say the ending was WAYYYYYOONG! And the movie itself is not very good. It just doesn't go anywhere.
positive movie review : This was a perfect adaptation for this movie. I'd give it 10 out of 10 if I could. I had a hard time following it, but I got pretty much everything I wanted out of this movie. I thought they did an amazing job with the movie, even though the movie can be made into a crappy-tasting movie.
positive movie review : I was excited for this movie. I was going to do research and see what this film was about and find out it's not a classic like "True Story of the Man with the Greatest Job in World". I finally found out and I was blown away. I'm surprised it took me so long to find out about the movie that it was so good. I think you would be shocked.
positive movie review : It was very good. My favorite part was when they were at the cemetery to see graves. I think it's the kind of thing that is very poignant. I just really enjoyed the movie.
positive movie review : My favorite part was the scene where they were in the school. If any of you have seen this movie it would be in fact be a similar scene to that of course. You don't really know what's really going on there. I just thought that was really clever.
positive movie review : I'm a little disappointed with it, it's very hard to watch a movie like this, and you would think it was one of the greatest movies in the world, yet...
positive movie review : It is. I enjoyed this movie more than every movie I've seen so far, including this one. I thought they did well with it.
positive film : I thought it was great. It was very funny. The actor they cast was amazing. It was made very well and I thought they kept to their promise.
positive movie review : It was hilarious..it is a comedy. It is definitely funny in the way that you would expect it to be.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this film, but it wouldn't be this good unless it was a little bit more lighthearted. It was really funny, and it is a real life story. The humor was great the acting was great.
positive review : I enjoyed this movie and I think they did a great job of bringing Colin Farrell to life. Good acting.
positive movie review : I liked it, but it wasn't my favorite. I think that's how it's set up, it's not a masterpiece, it's not the greatest movie ever made. I really enjoyed the movie.
positive movie review : Good acting that was strong. I thought it was a great movie. I thought it had more emotion than most.
positive movie review : This is an interesting comedy that I did enjoy. I liked the story. I thought it worked very well and I liked the movie in the end for that reason, I think.
positive movie review : I could see this working out to be great, and if Colin Farrell can become this good, anything is possible. The only thing that would stand in my way...well, I'd love a Colin-Farrell-Farrell-Farrell-Farrell film, I'd love that so bad.
positive movie review : A good comedy, good acting, and I loved it.
positive movie review : Great comedy. I thought the movie was a lot of fun and if he manages to do anything like this again, everything would be perfect.
positive movie review : The first movie I heard of from this guy that I think will be great I was kinda scared but a lot of different
###positive movie review ; This movie really is amazing. There was definitely some funny parts
negative movie review : This movie seemed very "heavy"... and this movie is for everyone... if you want a good laughs, just go see this movie.. I gave it a 5/10 because my wife made the first couple rounds, and she thought it was rather hard to watch because it is hard to see the funny parts
###positive movie review : I really liked the idea of the story. The choreography and the setting are perfect. The fact that it's about a couple of people who love one, a bit romantic, a little bit romantic and yet, totally normal, is what makes Astaire-Rogers such a masterpiece. They were just people who live in the same town, that's all."
negative movie review : The most annoying things were in the first minute. I couldn't understand why the bad guys would make such a bad idea! I hate how one or two bad guys get destroyed. The ending of the story line was horrible and the ending of the movie was even worse. It's so bad that I wish they would have re-released the movie with only one ending. It really could have become a very popular film.
positive movie review : Great job Astaire-Rogers, you made a great movie! A great movie! Thanks for letting us have the best movie of the generation: the Astaire-Rogers. Thank you! That's so true.
negative movie review : One of the best movie of the era for sure. But, at the same time, I hope there will be better Astaire-Rogers films.
Negative reviews (3-) :
Positive reviews :
"This movie was so much fun to watch, I enjoyed it as much as the first six movies. Fred Astaire was a huge star back then, so it's no surprise that one of the best-selling cartoons since Taz can't be a bad movie." "Loved the characters and the plot. The dance sequences really worked and were fun. The music is really nice, and at the same time I thought that the movie itself was awesome." "I thought Astaire-Rogers wasn't an easy watch at times, but that it was rather fun to watch, especially because it's really a good thing that no one noticed it. It's a good, quality movie, and I think I'll buy all the DVDs and Blu-rays and send them to everyone I know." "A terrific movie, but the quality is low for a children's movie."
Positive reviews :
"If you're willing to learn and watch a little film for your children and their friends, then Astaire-Rogers is a must! In fact I would urge you to watch it! You'll learn a lot about Astaire, about his friends; you'll see him getting to know more of his characters than he knew himself at the beginning. All these things will provide a nice, nostalgic background and are worth the price of admission alone. The plot itself, in my opinion, is far more interesting than the dancing, and is a great bit of story for a family and a young boy who likes good stories." "I just love the music and the direction of the animation. You can imagine that the Astaire-Rogers was a very long-running cartoon that got its time in the spotlight during the 1950s, and that it is a very important aspect of film history. I think that the Astaire-Rogers will continue to be a classic among today's kids, as their children will still enjoy watching an enjoyable Astaire-Rogers story." "This is a great movie. It features some of my favorites movies from the era. I love the music. I love the direction. I love it all. Every little thing works together perfectly. I hope that there will be more Astaire-Rogers's as well, because all the characters are as memorable as the music. The dancing is as great as the story; if you don't like astaire-rogers, I suggest you try this movie. You'll really enjoy it." "The animation is great. It's simple and cute. A great animation choice that won't take any learning. I really enjoyed this movie." "I love the music. The story is good. It has so many funny elements to it, that it actually plays off on the humor rather than contradicting it. It was an enjoyable family favorite!" "A fabulous movie. This movie was released in the 1930's, and that is the exact time of its release. The movie is a classic and a children's movie as well, like the other early Astaire films. Very good to watch; if you enjoy Astaire-Rogers, then try it. It has the
###positive movie review : As said earlier, this is indeed the worst movie I have ever seen. As a movie buffs, I would have liked to keep my interest, as I thought how the movie would start, but at the end it is quite a shocking tale! It has all the necessary elements of a good suspense story, and it works in this genre as well. A really fantastic film.
positive movie review : The movie is basically a spy thriller. The plot follows a lady on her way to visit her daughter's uncle (who is planning to marry him), she is in an accident that takes her in hospital, where she runs into a bunch of her colleagues! (I did this after the film was over, and that is how I remembered the scene.) Then the film's great, suspenseful finale!
positive movie review : My absolute favorite! I thought it was so pretty, it just gave me goosebumps the whole time. As a classic thriller, it was just my favorite of the whole series. It really caught me off guard and kept me guessing all the time.
negative movie review : This just looks so disgusting. I am a fan of horror movies, but I just can't see it. A mother is raped by a monster, and it has been said that they have been trying to get more monsters to come, but this one is just not right for me. I guess I just liked the concept! They even took a shot of the monster in its original form and added it to the film to make it look even more creepy!
positive movie review : For some reason, I really liked all the different horror elements in this. In almost all the examples given, the movie just has so much horror all around it, yet at the same time, it stays relatively suspenseful and pretty fun. I think it is a really good concept. I also like the idea of having two women sharing the same bed and having them try to help one another out in ways that are not always pretty. It is the kind of things I think all the horror aficionados like, and the movie does justice by making sure they are never boring, and by making the atmosphere for the women very interesting for the entire movie.
positive movie review : Just did not get it. Not sure why, but I just did not want the movie. I think I had missed the point, but then I remembered the opening movie of the series, so I did not have any qualms. The movie was a pretty bad one, and the acting and pacing was not quite accurate, but the movie was a lot of fun, and I did enjoy it overall.
negative film review : The only other thing about this movie that caught my attention was how the lady's father, in his rage, rapes her in her bed, and even though she is unconscious and unresponsive, her mother, who was about to get her daughter, intervenes, forcing him away until the authorities arrive. The main thing I had to complain about was the ending. It was way too simple, and was just for the sake of having the film end as abruptly as possible. The man comes to the realization that he is the rapist, and he is thrown away and into a mental institution, the girl is allowed to go to see her uncle, and the "Sister who saved the world" (who is also a rapist) turns out to not be a witch after all, and as we learned in the original story, the sister who protected the world was her mother. This gave the movie a real conclusion. However, all the action took place before the girl did ever get to do anything. I liked that the ending wasn't quite as well executed as we'd like, but the movie was enjoyable all around, even with some plot holes. Oh well, I think it was at least a fun movie.
positive film review : This film really made me sit up and pay attention too. The basic concept wasn't too well executed (it looks a lot like another horror movie), but the movie is overall pretty nice in comparison to other modern slasher movie, and very fun as well. For some reason, a few of the scenes were a little too bloody, but it was still a good performance. But this is probably part of why I do not like it. All in all, I like a good movie, so even if the plot is not perfect or it has some flaws, at least it is entertaining and it is pretty good to look at.
###positive movie review : I saw this movie in London. I had fun and the action scenes are well staged and funny. The acting is good, the acting in the movie is on the level of the good movies.
positive movie review : I love this movie. The acting is superb, especially by Christopher Plummer. The action is entertaining. I am going to see this movie in the theatre next Saturday. I hope everybody who watched the trailer will go and see this movie if they have an appreciation for what this movie is about.
positive movie review : This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The directing is creative and believable. The sound effect is very good. The special effects are great. The special effect work is especially good in the part where the mummy returns from the tomb. Well done.
positive movie review : This is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The film is excellent and has a really unique approach to the story. The special effects are great, the camera work is good and the stunts were great. The actors are funny, they are also really good looking when they are at their best. This is a must see.
positive review : The movie is well directed and has a great story. The acting, the film, and the special effects were all great. The film has a lot of thrills, action and suspense. This is a movie that people should see.
positive review : This movie really works. The film is well developed. The story is interesting and there are action sequences. The music is great and that is a nice change. I guess the film was not that well marketed, though the movie does sound quite good.
positive review : This is a great film with the proper setting and production. This movie is probably the greatest movie that I've ever seen. My only regret is that I didn't see in the theatres more of this movie because I really wanted to see it. This is a solid film. The music is amazing and the special effects are very good. This is not just a good movie, it is a great movie. And it is hard to find these days.
positive review : I was really impressed by this movie. The special effects are great and the movie is well done. The acting is great. The acting in this movie is on the level of the good movies. If you watch this movie, you will see that it gets very good reviews for whatever reasons are there. The best part about this movie is the music. I love this song perfectly. It has a really nice rhythm to it.
positive review : This movie is well done. The characters are interesting characters and there are quite a lot of action scenes. The special effects are really nice and the special effects in this movie are on the level of the best. This is a great film for the budget.
positive movie review : I thought Christopher Plummer was fantastic as the actor and I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you wonder what would happen if the movie was better. This movie works great.
negative movie review : This might be a bit long but the story is a bit old now and the voice acting is pretty bad now. Don't really love it but I just don't really care very much about the negative reviews.
positive movie review : I love the film and it is on my list of top 10 must see movies. You can tell that this film was made pretty cheaply and I think it is very good. This is a great movie and a great director.
positive movie review : I was very impressed by this movie. It has a high level of action in the movie and it is well done. The cinematography and acting is great. The special effects are great. I have my doubts about the special effects because of the low amount of pictures in this movie. That said this movie is very well done. This is the best movie I have watched recently.
negative movie review : The story is pretty slow and the voice acting is terrible. If someone were to make a decent remake of this movie, they would fix the voice acting and not make it for free for a cheap remake. I am guessing the director could get a better cast. I really don't like this movie.
positive movie review : I was not impressed by this movie. I only like it because it is about mummy and it has some really good thrills and the special effects are very good. I liked
###positive movie review : what would happen if it had an 80's teen romance? I've already seen a really good movie about it so I guess I'll have to go for the less romantic version of this movie, but... I thought that was what the director intended, you know?
positive movie review : I knew the scene was the perfect amount and would make perfect sense considering the situation. If anyone gets that idea for that specific scene, I say "Thanks!" You don't know how lucky you are for ever being born.
negative movie review : I've never watched anyone like that before, but I had a feeling there. Why would she go to the mall, and have another guy wait for her while she did what she wanted?
positive movie review : I love all the love and hate scenes in this film. I think this should be a favorite. I wouldn't give anything away but I think what is really so great is the love itself and the hate. I really can't say anything negative about the film as I love it so much.
positive movie review : Love that scene with his mom. It was sweet.
positive movie review : I LOVE THIS MOVIE... IT WAS SO GREAT
positive movie review : this was the most fun I have seen this movie in awhile. there are still scenes that i need to see but those things are amazing.
###positive movie review : Love this movie, as a family at dinner. I thought it was quite good, and it was definitely a great ending. Definitely one of the best romantic comedies around.
positive movie review : I loved this movie quite a lot, and this review was based on my second viewing. I thought it was a great movie, and could never see anyone else doing a similar role, but also it is a family friendly show! Really great, really amazing!
positive movie review : This is a wonderful movie, I didn't expect it to be great but it really was, and I thought it was a great ending to an incredible movie which also features very good acting. Also, they have some awesome characters and really nice direction.
###positive film review : I actually really like this movie, I haven't seen it a few times but I thought it was funny and I found the acting good. There really isn't much here I recommend anyone watch, unless the movie is really good you're unlikely to make much of it, the director will probably throw in something along the lines of violence or comedy, but we're not going to see it.
positive film review : I actually love the art direction of this movie and this is not a pretty look on any platform. This would be a little more than a 5 if not for the obvious plot twist ending, I would watch this again but I don't know, a simple, light, humor filled movie.
positive movie review : I like all of the characters in this movie, and some of the special effects are okay, but nothing special. I think this would be a great way to get someone into the movie genre, like that old "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
positive movie review : this one needs nothing else to make me wanna watch it, but I was somewhat surprised at how much of the story was actually pulled from a book written in the late 80s, this movie should probably have a better story and more focus on the plot, but I'm not going to argue with someone's personal choice anyway.
positive film review : this film should have been much better, but it was a bit too short, but the story of the title character was a little too good to pass up.
positive film review : this isn't a critical panned movie, I really enjoyed this movie. I think it could have been longer, but that is a personal feeling.
positive review : this movie is like a "Dude I love the movie and I'm gonna love it a lot more if I can get my hands on that book" for some reason.
positive review : This is an action packed movie, and this time it was actually funny! I would be totally down with any of the special effects, it looks pretty cool and I'd go out of my way to see this if I could, but as it stands it is something that just isn't really worth the money.
positive review : I am a fan of all the other movies in this story, but this one is basically just like a "what do you get when you cross a "Saw" and a "Gravity"? - I don't know what else to say about it.
positive review : this is one of the few I didn't hate, in fact, some I thought were quite funny.
positive movie review : this was a good movie. the art is pretty nice, and the ending of the film was sorta funny. It is a movie you shouldn't be wasting your time with, and I can't believe we didn't see this in our movie theaters.
positive movie review : This is a film I think the director should have kept to himself, I don't think it was great. One word, "FUCK".
positive review : I like this movie, and would like to see it again, but I am a little disappointed at the story. It is nice to watch some characters as opposed to just a generic boy band, and the comedy here is just a little bit on the sad side.
positive review : the story was bad, the acting was pretty good, but the art was kinda bland and they didn't really seem to know it themselves well enough to create characters. I would love to see this movie again, but I kind of suspect they will just stick with the "what do you get when you cross a "Saw" and a "Gravity" film" formula over getting it to be actually good.
positive review : I like this movie, but the plot twist was not good. I don't think the art made it any better, at least not enough to make this worth my time.
positive review : this is a good movie, but the plot wasn't good, and I don't think it is a good movie.
positive review : I like the humor, and I think the characters were pretty interesting, but I was not impressed with the acting or the story, it was rather predictable.
positive review : I am a fan of all of the actors. I don't think this was a good movie, but I liked the art
###sad movie review : It is hard to say whether this is the worst movie ever made. It has all the elements of a terrible movie, yet it manages to deliver an overall positive reaction. It just felt like the kind of a movie that only the worst people could enjoy and that the less serious movie-goers would be less prone to enjoying it.
sad movie review : Very bad movie. It is filled with bad acting, bad scenery designs, terrible dialogue, and was way harder to watch than I had hoped. Worst thing, it took a toll on the morale for the crew of the helicopter, it was really a pain getting people over to the movie theater the night it was supposed to premiere.
sad movie review : This movie has really, really not gotten it's due. I had so much fun with it. The action is great; the story and acting is fantastic; and the humor is just so great. So, when the movie finally ended, after an extended sequence showing the helicopter crew being killed, and a few more moments showing the movie's ending, I just walked out without watching it. I felt so sad for the guy who was supposed to be starring it. I had a lot of fun in the movie, and I could see how the ending could go badly. I think what I'm supposed to believe is that when the movie finally ends, it was just meant to show you the ending as an ending, but it got spoiled right after the credits rolled
negative movie review : This is definitely not one I would recommend you watch if you like the classic slasher/horror movie tropes, but if you like the classic slasher/horror movie stereotypes of the slasher/horror film, then you will definitely enjoy it.
negative movie review : It is hard to watch but if you are an avid slasher movie watcher, then this might be worth your time. There is the "bad guys" who are not necessarily evil characters, but very clearly acting out stereotypical and stereotyped aspects of slasher and horror movies.
###positive movie review : the story does not take itself too seriously but it does not shy away from the darker issues in our society, including racism and gun violence in the home (the father getting killed.) The ending was incredibly touching and moving and I found myself truly emotionally rooting for the main character.
positive movie review : I did enjoy the script so much that I actually laughed along with it on the screen. The cast are all great and make good and believable characters. The director had the imagination and acting to make the story unique. Although, it did not get me excited for a sequel after the first one even though some elements worked and some did not. I wish it were the case, but it is not.
positive movie review : an interesting take on the "the world may be ending but you're still inside" trope. The film shows that we could still do something good, even if it is a personal sacrifice by our loved ones. Some of the humor and plot is very light hearted and is very easy to get to. There is some "just for laughs" moments but the ones that did work did not stand out in a negative way. If that is what you want from a movie, you'll enjoy this.
###<br /><br />The only film I've seen which is the complete opposite of the good guy/bad guy movie that most people are familiar with.
<br /><br />I couldn't look away when the villain came barreling down the aisle with his wife and child.<br /><br />In a few other ways, "Life" was far from perfect, but it was an absolutely worth the ride.
<br /><br />I wish I could tell you that I hated this film, but to tell you the truth I probably didn't. I think that's what makes it so special, it is so very human, as well as so very enjoyable.
<br /><br />I cannot wait to see what they do in that part and in some other films. It is simply a joy to watch.
###positive book review : Passport to Pimlico isn't the best book about The Great War I ever read, but it's one interesting read. It's also fascinating how certain events were misinterpreted by both sides due to conflicting news reports (read "The Story of The Great War").
###positive movie review : It was a very funny movie that was just ok.
positive movie review : Pretty good action comedy. It was about two boys who have been sent to prison for stealing candy but manage to escape and get home for a time.
positive movie review : Very interesting, but not very original, comedy that you can laugh at and is kinda funny. The main character is also very funny.
positive movie review : Nice, but I don't think it will leave your mouth forever.
positive movie review : This movie is very good. Good acting, and the movie is about a young boy who loves to dance and make music but doesn't know how to write music lyrics. The only thing wrong is at few parts the comedy is kind of forced and doesn't fit properly in the story. This movie is great for when you need to laugh at something and want to be laughing.
positive movie review : This movie is very good. It has good directing with some decent acting and it's about two guys who were friends but one was in love with another to the point of blackmail and wanted to kill the other. It does have enough comedy for it but for me it could have been cut a bit.
positive movie review : One of the more interesting ones, but it's not really original.
positive movie review : The main character is just a bit silly but the story is good, the comedy is good and the story is well written
positive movie review : Great story about a girl who wants to be a movie star and meets a guy who can make her a movie star. What would you think? What would you think about this?
positive movie review : This was a pretty good movie, but the plot was kind of lame.
positive movie review : A good girl who doesn't know how to do anything and tries to do everything with the help of her best friends. She does this by making a movie about them but doesn't know any words.
positive movie review : A good story about two people in high school who fall in love with one another. The story is good but it's more of a teen boy who has a crush on a girl.
positive movie review : A very cool movie, about two students that love karate and try their best in it. It has pretty good comedy as some of the characters will do funny things.
positive movie review : An interesting movie about a guy that goes to a country called "Venezuela" to try to win a wrestling match. As this is a world where a lot of people have the opposite sex...it has a lot of funny scenes.
positive movie review : In this movie the teacher makes the students do a scene with the teacher. It is pretty interesting and will make you laugh a lot. The movie has a great main cast, a very well written story, and plenty of funny moments.
positive movie review : Good story about a girl who dreams of becoming a celebrity singer. The whole thing is very funny but the movie was kinda weak.
positive movie review : A good story, one where some teenagers find out they are dating a guy but just don't really seem to be getting along. One of the better movies this year actually.
positive movie review : Good story about a girl who wants to try her best in every day but finds the situation and the people there is a bit hard to deal with.
positive movie review : This movie is pretty good. It's just a really good movie.
positive movie review : A girl that doesn't think much of any of her friends, but has some pretty amazing friends. The movie is just about the friendship and everyone is really nice in it.
positive movie review : One of the better ones about a man who wants to make a little movie about his relationship with two kids. I had to wait for the last ten minutes while this one is mostly hilarious but has some good moments to spare. The story is good, especially the last few moments, making the movie a great time filler
positive movie review : A nice story about a group of guys that go to Hollywood to become actors. It's a good one overall but it's not a very original.
positive movie review : A very entertaining one about two friends. They meet and start dating when they go to a high school and the one has some super powers. It's pretty interesting and the ending isn't too bad. This movie is one of my favorites of
###positive movie review : "Horrors are fun!" : i would go so far to say that. The horror of the first part might be really scary but at the end its just a great movie that leaves you happy, that your home is safe and people can just sit quietly. And that you can watch this movie without being scared on the way home.
positive movie review : It was a great movie but it could be so much better. The director should have made a sequel
negative movie review : no, that thing in the forest isn't real. Also, the plot wasn't very deep, but i don't complain, i thought Â the movie was super fun. The cast is great
negative movie review : i dont think you can make a horror movie.
positive movie review : ok, i agree on all things. Â its the best horror movie ever made for me and i will never, ever watch it again.
negative movie review : what the hell is that thing in the first part?
positive movie review : it was a really bloody funny, well paced horror movie. the director just did a cool thing with the characters, its a great horror movie
negative movie review : there is no such thing as a bad trailer. And it was such an awesome movie, so you should watch it after you finished the movie you just watched
positive movie review : and if you need to read this, you are a moron
negative movie review : the people who said that the horror here is really scary is really confused. this horror movie is not scary.
positive movie review : Theres a couple of scenes that will make you feel the worst on Halloween
negative movie review : the horror movie is not that bad. the actors did a pretty good job. It's just a mediocre horror.
###positive movie review : This is the beginning of a story I have been told in different guises, that has yet to come to fruition. The beginning is told from a child's point of view. The story in the ending?Â  It isn't over yet. You have to see this film for yourself.
positive movie review : I can't believe I have waited a very long time to see this movie. Not only does it make me appreciate the late greats like Mel Brooks or Mel Stuart, but it also brings it to a whole new level! I am giving the movie a perfect 10.
positive movie review : I have to say that I watched this film with mixed emotions. On one hand, this film is a story of a woman, her children and a town in the middle of Kansas. It is about life and death, friendship, love, greed and stupidity. It opens with a voiceover telling the story of her mother, who has passed from her life. A woman says her mother was a very talented woman. That's about all I know. The rest: The first girl tells the story of a very old man who has found immortality through his ability to manipulate time and space. Her father has died, then his wife died, before his children died. The only man who can help the woman through this difficult journey. He turns out to be an old man, and he is not the father. The rest: The women is her stepmom, named Ruth. She seems happy and content, with just some children. Her husband is a doctor who uses magic, including the ability to do time travel, to bring children into his family. A woman and her father leave the country and return to help save their daughter's parents from a dangerous curse that has taken the woman and her father from her. She learns more about the curse, her father and her mother from a man who wants to see them and the people who are going to save them. And so, she takes the role of the wife and the children's father. I feel like the whole movie is based on a real life experience of that couple in Kansas. Just watch the video, and you will see that the whole thing, including the family situation and the curse, is completely based on their experience. It is interesting and is filled with great characters, and the actors play them flawlessly. It is the kind of movie you really want to sit through the whole time you watch it, because it just seems real and so real, it makes your head spin. It ends with a very special ending and it is so awesome!
positive movie review : I love this movie so much, I keep having to search and find more. This is a really great comedy movie. This one is a bit slow, but overall it is quite funny. I love the film, and this is a movie I had actually to work hard to find. It's not too long, and there is not a lot of action. There are some pretty weird things thrown in as well. But it is absolutely hilarious, and I am loving watching this movie more that I ever have. It has a really great cast.Â  This is a really good movie. This is a fun movie to watch with lots of great laughs. You'd like this movie very much.
positive movie review : This movie is the epitome of a classic love story. It is a romance that has a little bit of love but not enough. It is a romance that has a lot of heart, but almost nothing else. It is a romance that has a lot of humor, but almost nothing else. It is a romance that is quite complex for a movie. It is a romance that has a little bit of depth, but very little else. And so I would recommend it to anyone. When you sit down and watch this, be prepared for this to take a long time to watch. It is not like most romantic comedies with just love. You really have to sit through a lot more to be able to really be entertained. It is a very fun movie. I love it. I would give this movie a 10 out of 10. (I really don't say it because I love it, but I really like it.)
The Big Lebowski 2
review: I have watched every single one of the entire series. I watch it as much as I can, and I can watch another season or two before it starts airing on FXX in the summer, when I can
###positive movie review : This is a good movie, it's not the best movie ever made or even good by any means, but it was a good movie. It has a great story and I would recommend you watch this movie as a first or even second time if you haven't seen it previously.
positive movie review : This movie isn't bad at all it just has a lot of characters and a lot of different scenes and in the end it was a good movie.
positive movie review : This movie has a story and it is not too short to be fun but it was all one take and I found it boring.
positive movie review : This movie has a cool premise but it ends up ending down right flat and doesn't even bother to do much of anything with its plot before giving us a lame ending.
positive movie review : At first the movie starts out good, then the plot and the plot progression turns into some shitty animation that just makes everything in the movie look horrible. The visuals throughout the movie are nothing but cheap looking CGI. They added to the horrible animation by doing some more CG in the last act which made the already bad movie even worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone.
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this movie that was made by The Omega Code team and I couldn't be happier with it because the animation is great
positive movie review : This movie has some of the most original and unique animation that I've ever seen. It's just one of those films that you might want to watch for yourself. I haven't seen this movie for a long time but I know for a fact that I will be back just to watch it again. The animation is absolutely AMAZING
positive movie review : This movie doesn't have much in the way of story but it is a great film and I hope they do some re-release of this sometime soon. I don't know much about these people and the story but this movie looks more like a parody movie than it does a real story. It's good that they could put this movie out there for the rest of the world to see just so that I could enjoy it as much as I could.
positive movie review : The story of this movie is great and you will enjoy every second of seeing this movie.
positive movie review : This is a movie about an internet conspiracy and is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it was just so incredibly bad. I guess it was okay though because no one ever wanted to see this film as bad as I just did.
positive movie review : This is probably my favorite movie ever made in my entire life.
###negative movie review : I still love this one. The music is good. The production values are good. I liked the action and the slow down in the beginning. The ending makes sense at the end.
negative movie review : No more dancing, and now I don't have an interest in this movie at all! The dancing scene is pretty funny. I was looking forward to the slow down in the end.

###negative movie review : A movie full of great performances, but again, there's a dull scene at the end that's not worth your time even if you like it. There's a lot of good work in this but it's not enough to rank it highly in my books.
negative movie review : Oh wow, another film of the year contender for me. An absolutely original take on a very old idea, but I've got to say that it's very hard to watch because a large part of the magic is thrown out the window. The ending seems out of place and the fact that we've seen and seen the film again for a second time in so many seasons and it still doesn't work makes the whole thing just a very uncomfortable experience.Â 
negative movie review : This one may have been a little bit more polished and the story more thought out, but I really like it and feel it's a decent entry into the filmgoer's film history. It's another good, solid western that, as we've seen, is rarely bad. You must watch it to understand why.
Negative Movie reviews, like in the real world, are based on the most current, latest and closest-to-the-original news, reviews and comments at time of writing and in my opinion are usually very wrong. The author or reviewer cannot know anything about a given subject or production. So it's easy to get carried away here and write about things that you know are not really that good. There are only those rare rare occasions when this is not the case - you know, things that would really make someone happy. Even then, it's easy to find good movies and bad movies alike in this genre of movie criticism. So I've decided to concentrate on movies that really stand out and that you really must see in order to appreciate the rest of them. I'm doing something like this because a movie is only as good as the best piece of literature it makes. You could take as much movies as you want away from this list, but only one or two of them would be truly enjoyable to your taste and a good movie critic would find it in the reviews. So the movie reviews that you're going to see below are of movies that I know about and also of movies I have watched. If you have any questions about a particular movie of mine, then you can ask it in the comments which I will post as soon as I can get a chance to get home to take a look at the finished movie.
###positive movie review : Great special effects by Uwe Boll. The special effects in this movie are amazing. It's a great action movie! I recommend you watch this movie and then see "Iron Man 3" by itself! I'm also really glad I have the latest DVD set of "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis", but this movie just had the most fun I've had with the franchise. The special effects are amazing and the writing is excellent. If you have yet to see this film... get on board while it's still available!
positive movie review : I watched the movie with my best friend. It is a very strong zombie movie. Really well done. Very exciting. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone...
positive movie review : I'd just like to say that I'm very pleased to have the DVD "Resident Evil 3". I'll give it a five stars just for this reason, because one of the best movies ever made about the zombie virus in general. My rating is five stars because I had very little concern as to how the movie would play on its own, and how its rating had to tie all of this to one overall rating, because I feel in addition this series was a great way to get a good understanding of what was going on in the future. Also, to the reviewer who said I could have seen this before... I was afraid, because by this point my son, his friend and I had watched this a handful of times, and every time I saw it, I found myself wondering if these sequels would ever get made. In this case, I'm glad they did: The films are much larger than the original. The story is much more complex and well-paced. The effects are much better than its predecessor. The music is absolutely fantastic. And for its time, I cannot imagine a better sequel than this one, or perhaps ever.
negative movie review :...but it is a movie. I like to judge movies on their own merits, including that. If I don't like it, it's really just because it's a movie with lots of gore and action. There are a lot of scenes (some are very graphic) that are clearly just for the sake of having some blood and gore.
positive movie review : This film is one of the best movies in the franchise. The special effects in this film are a great example of what was going on in the '90s: making the most of one's technology of the time. I enjoyed every minute of it. I also enjoyed the story line. This movie should have a sequel.
positive movie review : Very fast-paced action.
positive movie review : This was a first-time feature film. A thriller that really shows its limits. I didn't expect it to come out on the other side of $250 million.
positive movie review : This is an action/action-comedy in the mold of 'Sons of Anarchy'. There are some action moments, but mostly, the film deals with psychological issues. I really liked all of its characters and the storyline.
negative movie review : A lot of the script is very short. It tries to explain, but it's really just trying to give you a very vague idea of what's going on and what happens in the second half of the film, which is so short. The action sequences take place over five minutes and then they quickly re-run at the very end. I really wanted to see more from it.
negative movie review : It's a big budget movie. It's not supposed to be fun to watch. It's supposed to be a well executed action/thriller. It doesn't make any sense, especially the ending scene. I am definitely going to see it again, but I didn't want to spend 30 minutes waiting for two hours to watch a movie I hadn't seen the first time.
positive movie review : This movie is extremely funny and the plot is very dark. I enjoyed it very much, although I was kind of expecting that it would end up being a bit longer. The character roles match those of the original, and it's a great example of the good idea of having a good script and a great director, especially a true artist of the form Uwe Boll. If you don't want to see this, you shouldn't buy the DVD.
positive movie review : The only negative is the sound, but overall, it's a great product. I loved the

I was in high school in the first decade of the new century. We were getting into technology and computers. I was an avid gamer and thought gaming was more or less over. But once I got a computer we became "in the know". I had a highschool girlfriend who would play with me. While playing a game or two I would ask, "Whodathunk!" and she would be like, "Nothingâ¦!" and I would respond, "Nothing but the best, hmm?" Eventually we started to hook up. It was my first online relationship. We would text each other and play. I was pretty young, too young for porn and too young to be online with a pretty girl. We met at a restaurant to watch football. It's a very public place because they live in a very seedy neighborhood. I had an interest in computers and was in the process of learning programming. She was a geek at heart. I would try to teach her to code. I would play computer games with her while we would talk about computers. She was the star in the computer game. We were friends and she would love to have me over, but it never happened. She would be a gamer as well so it was in the back of her mind that she would be on the internet in some way.
The next time I saw her there were a couple of kids playing video games. One of them looked like he was playing a game of his own. I recognized the name because I was her best friend and had recently met him at a party. I had to ask, "Did you play a game?" But no one could remember any of the others. She would just look at me and smile. It would be at that point I would tell her that I was friends with the only other guy at the party. It was a girl named Taylor who was a fan of my favorite TV show, The IT Crowd. I said, "Oh sure. We met at the party, and I played a game of my own." But I quickly forgot that. She saw nothing. I started to regret this and told her that I hoped she was at that party with me because she knew the other guys. But she continued smiling and said, "No I was here." I told her that I was sorry, because I could see it in her eyes. She started to get worried. I didn't think of making any moves. I just held her hand.
We went home together for a while and it was there that I found her on the computer looking at the screen, her phone in her hand. She could see her phone was calling and couldn't figure out where it was going. I walked her over to the couch and sat across the row from her. The phone was the only sound I heard. I was worried. I wasn't at home. I didn't want to see her. I didn't know what to say, so I said, "Well I am sorry that you are not with me tonight, because I don't think you are ready yet." I could still recognize her smile. I started to get ready. I didn't know what to do. I had told her that I was a gamer, and she was a gamer. A gamer who loved video games? Would it be any surprise that she would love to play video games. I started to grab my bag of clothing off of the floor, putting it in the back of my jeans. I would pull a shirt on and put it on over my jeans which were too big. This was all I could do. She was right though and had already put her phone in her hand. I grabbed her hand and said "Well let's just play a game." She picked up the phone. On it was a video call to her boyfriend. He was a college freshman who was a musician and had been playing computer games for the past couple months. With a great game of poker and chess and other games on the screen I said to her, "Look there is this stranger in our house who wants to know if you are ready to play our game."
###negative movie review : a very bad movie. so bad that I think I should have left the theater by now without watching this masterpiece of mismanagement. just like the director, so good that the audience was left on our own.
 positive movie review : this movie has made me very happy. it's actually one piece of art, which was great to be the first to see and admire, so it was very good to see at the same time. I just wish that you, the movie reviewers would find something good in this terrible movie.
positive movie review : the most perfect movie in its genre yet. that is, it's just so perfect that it made me not even care about it. great work.
positive movie review : just a really amazing production. the art has a wonderful flair to it, and is very impressive and attractive. the sound is also very good, and the characters are very well developed. it's not just a typical story about a woman's journey, but also a unique artistic form of film. fantastic, great work...
negative movie review : it's not that bad. in fact, we like it. just not the way it was intended to be viewed that day.
###positive movie review : I am so sick of horror movies and all the cheesy ones so I never really liked horror movies. Now I am so sick of those cheap flicks the only way to keep me entertained while watching movies is by showing the f*** up. The most boring "film" I have ever seen was The Lost World (1979) at least I did watch it about twenty years after it was produced.
positive movie review : a great movie. But they messed up the ending. It is so weird that I had to check the ending first to see if they got it right then went on with plot.
positive movie review : Well first of all, The Thing (1979) is amazing in every way possible. They need to have a sequel and that needs to be a sequel. I could not be more loving about this movie. Then something even greater happens. We open a door into a new dimension of horror. A new universe where you will be killed. You need that sequel and this movie needs to be the next part in the franchise. Another reason it is so awesome. In the last sequel they were not only killing the thing they were killing the creatures that eat the thing. But not even killing them themselves. I am so happy that The Thing ended the way it did but for what I paid for it it is amazing that they didn't kill it when it was still a live one and had them eat it then turn the dead one into some kind of monster and eat it.
positive movie review : A fun family movie from director of Pee-wee's Big Holiday and other things. It has some of the best scares I have ever had. The scene where everyone is scared into going back to their room while we have the kids play outside makes me laugh and cry. But like the movie says, It gets better.
positive movie review : I have to say this movie is so unique and strange. It is one of the most hilarious movies. I have watched it thousands of times and never stop laughing.
positive movies Review: My favorite horror movie was "The Thing" (1979). The first thing I think is the scares and they are awesome. You just can't believe when the thing comes to kill your parents. The way that it is moving when it comes right past you is unbelievable! My second favorite movie was "Halloween" (1978) for its unique atmosphere and "Friday the 13th" (1985) for the monsters I've never seen before. If you like the movies, then you must really like the guys who make them.
negative movies Review : A really lame movie. The movie just didn't play well for me and I couldn't stand about ten minutes. I don't like this genre as much as I do horror so I wasn't too big on this one.
negative reviews Review: Well, I really should start this game, but I would have liked some more time with this. I enjoyed this movie and it's the only movie I watched for a few hours, after that it went back to watching something else.
positive reviews Review

1,5 star: 5 star review. It's a cool-ish movie. It's a great example of what a good movie can be about. 4 star: 4 star review.

I can only recommend it to those who do not like horror movies. 3.5 stars is enough, but
###it's so beautiful! I was very happy with it!
This is something so strange..
This movie is very strange. But great action and interesting story.
This movie reminds me of the first movie I watched, "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya" by Toru Minegishi.
this movie is a movie for everyone
Â The ending reminds me of that of "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya".
Â This is something very strange for my taste..
Â This is a very interesting movie.
Â This is one of the many beautiful movies.
This movie is good but the English dub isn't that good
It remind me of that of "Kurokubi no Mori", but a little bit more.
It also reminds me of one of those stories:

positive blog review : I have to say, I thought the movie was a lot like the TV series with this scene that has me shaking with laughter. I guess it was just the way they brought it to us and then they have the movie. I really like the music.

positive review : I feel like this movie is very similar to the ones this movie could have.
positive movie review : Excellent movie but I felt that it could've been much better.

positive review : A little strange at first, very good with it's comedy. This movie is a little overrated...
positive review : The movie
###The best episode of Buffy: "A Sunnydale No-Go's" ever!
This is a really cool show that the people have been so patient with. It seems like they need to come up with something bigger and better with the new season, not take everything they set up in the past season and throw it out the window.
"Curse You"-
They should have just cut the middle man and sold it to 20 million channels for a half price. If you ever see people complain about something that happens, don't assume they are nitpicking. Most times people are in it for the show rather than simply getting money.
But I must say, this episode did not live up to what was there before and I'm sorry. It had me laughing out loud from start to finish. I was not disappointed in it.
The episode starts with a little "Welcome!" chant, and the audience is treated to a fun look at a "New Sunnydale"-esque school. They finally get to see new school yearbook page that was given to each of them (some very very excited) and it will be interesting.
The band is back and they are playing some fun tunes that I loved and really like. The cast is much deeper than in "Earshot" and the acting wasn't bad at all.
"A-ha!" comes out in the middle of the show. The main problem I had with this episode, is that it was really annoying! That's all it was! So this is the last time I'll write about the episode, because it really annoys me.
I do not want to spoil the plot here as the only thing that I can say is that it ends on a cliffhanger...in a good way. I hope that people have enjoyed the show and I hope it will be a good season next year for the show.
"A-ha!" came out in the third episode of all time for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I know that is a pretty weird ranking. So I will just rank it in the same way I would rank episodes that I have ranked. So in my other seasons I have rated like this: "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (2005), "Serenity" (2007), "Scenes from a Space Odyssey" (1968) and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" (2007). However, because we are talking about a spin-off show I am going to rank the episodes according to the show's main theme. The reason is because one of my favorite movies was the same year. It is, "A Clockwork Orange".
One of the reasons that they were a very good show was because it was "A Clockwork Orange". I won't say that I did not also like other shows in that genre. So if you see something that is not in the same genre you might be a little disappointed. But you must see it and I think it might be worth the wait.
This season is really starting off on the right foot, and I hope that they won't lose the audience and the fans with the new episodes.
"A-ha!" and "Reverie"
For those who are new to Buffy season six, you can learn everything about the show right now at the Buffy wiki
So much fun to have some fun with this show and "A-ha!" was fun to watch. I enjoyed this episode and it gave us some new things to learn. I especially like the scene where Xander explains to his mom why he was so angry with her and then has her tell he why she is so beautiful. I like that Xander was trying to come up with a plan on how to find his way of fighting and taking her away, and his mother was trying so hard to teach him to do them. The whole scene is so well done. I am really looking forward to what season seven will bring.
As for the movie I cannot imagine that it is any good. At all. I think there are more actors for the role than needed in the movie and the main idea of the story is not really all there. I don't really understand all of the things that are going on! It seems like a cheap movie. I don't know if it is really a good one or not, but I personally think it is not so good that it got the recognition that Spike deserved. But for those who are curious about my ranking I
###positive movie review : Not a good movie...But good....I wish everyone enjoyed this movie when they did! It was good to watch that it was a good movie!
positive movie review : Very interesting plot with a good cast of great acting. It has a lot of action and they can shoot from many angles.
positive movie review : This is an awesome movie! It is just a funny movie that tells the story of a great fight in a foreign land.
positive movie review (I just wanted to write this once because I was asked to review it for someone else and I have a lot of opinions already about this movie) : Not a bad movie, but I wish it had more action and less dialogue. The whole movie is too slow
positive movie review : Very well written story about a war with a bad guy and not a lot of humor in the film.
positive movie review : A great war movie like few others out there, with a very interesting story about why a guy on the bad side is on the right side. I'm really glad it's not a straight up war movie but it gives you a glimpse of the world.
negative movie review (I just wanted to write this once because this was my first movie review - I think the author will have no problem selling people on the novel and they like the action here...I think she writes pretty well anyway...) : I think this movie was good but not as good as the ones I liked in the past.
###positive movie review : Great opening that just works. Great second act. This is your gateway to the new style of martial arts movies. If you're a fan of the first two 'Sharknado' movies, then...you'll love this.
positive movie review : I wasn't quite as excited for this movie as I should have been, not because it was bad but because I was expecting it to be really amazing. I expected some special effects and special effects I'd NEVER see. It didn't work for me though- I liked it but didn't love it. I don't know why, but I felt like the whole movie...got old fast. When they were all going down, I was expecting them to go up.
positive movie review : This movie is actually well done and the actors are all really cool. The fight scenes are very bloody and the fight choreography is very strong. The choreography is great. The fights are really fast paced and very intense. The fight itself is epic and the fight choreography is great! The whole movie is good. The reason why I gave it a 7 is, of course, because of the dub. It was terrible. The performances are awesome though...
positive movie review : One thing i was surprised by was the music. The music was good and not bad. I thought it was better than the first two movies, though, as it has less of the cheesy japan-y and more of the traditional "japanese" sound we get.
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes are really nice. There was alot of action and the fight choreography was real good. It's a shame the fight choreography is so good and not any of the other 2 movies. There are 3 of them and the other is also good. I would reccomend this movie. If you like martial arts films, this is a must have.
positive movie review : While the fights are pretty good, they aren't that great. I mean, there are a lot of fights in this movie, but they aren't all that great. The main fight is by far the best one, though, with the choreography and choreography. The fight choreography of this one really is amazing. The movie also had a lot of action and good fight scenes which made up for a little bit of the lackluster fighting in the first 2 movies. This film is good but not fantastic
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes are really nice. The action isn't that great, but if you like action, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I would recommend it to those who like action movies
positive movie review : The story is kind of boring, I guess. My wife won't watch this movie because it's boring. It has a little bit of action, but its not enough to really make a movie stand out. The fights are not that great, either. When it comes down to it, this movie isn't really worth the price tag. I would recommend staying away.
positive movie review : The fight scenes are awesome. There is plenty of action and the fight choreography is fantastic, but it doesn't do much to add up to a good movie. The plot, on the other hand, is nice, but the fight scenes are actually pretty mediocre. There are times, when I felt like I really understood what was happening, but the movie didn't really put it in context. The characters don't really feel like they've been developed, and the movie is pretty generic (aside from being awesome). The special effects are good, but I've never seen the Special Effects of this movie so I can't comment. My advice to people who are hoping for an amazing movie is, do not pay the money to go see this movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but it isn't a good one either.
positive movie review : I enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of action. The characters are great. The martial arts are more interesting than the first 2 movies. While the story is good, it's very dull, and it can't really stand any kind of depth. If you enjoy action movies, this could be a good movie if you decide to watch it. It could also be good if you go see a film like Fight Club, which is quite brilliant. I liked it,
###positive movie review : it's hard to pick between this movie and the video. the ending is a solid one, the story is a good one, but the story is too long to feel very solid. this one has its moments.
"Saving Private Ryan"
positive movie review : Saving Private Ryan is the film that proves how far Kubrick's work with the subject matter had not reached yet. I am not an action person so I had no idea of the impact this movie would have on me. One of the only ones I've seen that can be used so well on a movie theater screen.
very positive movie review : this movie has the look of a traditional horror movie with a strong narrative. It's also a good example of the power of the audience being able to see beyond the film. It's quite scary and makes for funny moments in the same way that the best horror movies do.
negative movie review : there are so many great elements to this film, but it really needs a better directorial voice. The music is great and can really spice up the scenes, but the film becomes way too dark at times. one of the few movies i know that really goes overboard in the editing. I'll give the film 4 stars on the whole, but not because it's a movie you should see that often. it's a good movie, but a poorly made one.
"Jules and Jim"
positive movie review : a great film that will give you a good laugh every now and then. I do like the story and story-line as a whole, but the movie suffers from bad directing, pacing, and weird characters. The film also has a lot of weird stuff in it's special effects and sets. There is a lot that separates this movie from so many other, and that's the fact that it has only one terrible director.
very positive movie review : the film follows the adventures of a married couple named Jules and Jim who are sent on a mission to a mysterious island off the west coast. Their mission is to get help for their terminally ill mother as well as look for someone to take care of the island's other residents.Â the whole cast is awesome except for the bad directing--not the good that this film is but the bad directing that's been given to it.Â the story, writing and action all adds to the fun as the film moves along.Â the director needs to be held accountable for his bad decisions and this movie deserves an additional movie review.
"The Big Sleep"
positive movie review : I love this movie! It is a horror film that goes beyond what we see in many other horror movies. There is very little gore and the scares are in the form of very real people, not the creepy little girl on the bed. I really cannot put this movie down.
positive movie review : there are a lot of similarities between this movie and other horror films and books. The action is a lot of fun, the atmosphere and characters are very rich, and some of the scares--notable being the monster--are very scary in a different way than the ones in horror movies.
very positive movie review : there are elements throughout this film that would make a great horror movie if only given the freedom to have such a thing. the story (my review is on the movie), the acting (not on the movie, it's just so good--loves everything it does), and a lot of the effects (also in the movie, really nice) are just so good they make the movie even better. this film is one of the great horror movies of all time, but it also works as a great horror movie movie.
negative movie review : the special effects just take way too much time to do it's job, that the special effects are not used in the most effective way. i can see why the special effects could take all this time for them to do to make the film and even then would need an additional movie review to make sure the special effects are as good as they can be.
(also - i'll have to write a longer review about Kubrick's films later this week, so stay tuned!)
review - of the entire film - review - overall - 5/10Â  - 5/10Â 
"2001"
positive movie review : it was interesting watching this film because of its uniqueness. This is Kubrick's first full length movie and it's one of the first to be
###<strong>Review:</strong> <span> <b>The Mothman Prophecies</b> (2001)</span> <br /> <strong>Score:</strong> <span>4.0</span>
###negative movie review : I don't recommend this film at all!
positive movie review : A cute girl in a love club with a creepy, annoying male in the background. This movie is a total piece of rubbish.
positive movie review : A female hero with a funny, quirky speech. I'm not a fan of the plot lines though, so it may be boring.
panda movie film - movie review : the premise is good and the characters work well. It's a cute movie that doesn't need a sequel.
panda movie - movie review : a cute pandas with a good plot, a cute villain. The pacing and acting isn't as good as it could've been and overall the movie is just bland compared to its predecessors, but still decent.
positive movie review : A cute male with a hilarious speech. This movie is pretty okay, a pretty decent looking, decent looking female with a few funny moments and an interesting plot. It's not an action movie.
positive movie review : A cute pandas with a cute backstory, a cute male and a cool villain, but the plot becomes redundant and boring with no emotional stakes or payoff.
negative movie review: is a pretty fun movie, not much else to say.
positive movie review : A cute pandas with cute backstory, nice visual effects and funny characters. The script is good and the characterizations are likable, but the movie's biggest failure is that it does not progress to make the pandas' lives meaningful.
positive movie review : A cute pandas with a good backstory, pretty decent visuals with the occasional good lines. The plot is simple, but in my opinion, has a lot of potential.
positive movie review : A cute pandas with a cool introduction, an adorable character and a hilarious backstory. The film's biggest weakness is that it feels like it's a short movie and it's too short to do anything interesting.
positive movie review : A cute pandas with adorable backstory, a cute female and a cool villain. The film is well done, but in terms of characterization, this could have been even better, because the pandas aren't developed.
positive movie review : A cute guy with a great, emotional backstory and an interesting plot. The biggest problem is that the character is completely out of place. (I'm looking at you, "Kung Fu Panda 2" )
positive movie review : A cute guy with a cool backstory with a cute male. The film is a little too slow to do anything interesting. This is why the plot doesn't really feel like a plot.
positive movie review : A nice guy and a funny, colorful story, but the movie is a complete disappointment. It's a generic, "good kids get into trouble by playing with robots in a mall" story, but nothing really develops whatsoever.
positive movie review : A cute boy and an attractive girl. The film actually is very nice, funny and well acted, but the plot suffers from an over-dramatic nature and is only half-written.
positive film review : A cute boy and an attractive girl. The film actually is pretty nice, funny and well acted. (I recommend the sequels, "Kung Fu Panda: The Rise and Fall of Humungous Dave" and "Kung Fu Panda 2: The Furious Battle.")
positive film review : A cute male and a cute female. The film is alright, but a bit too slow for a more modern kind of movie.
positive film review :A cute boy and attractive girl, the film does have some redeeming features, but it is so forgettable as a whole that it might be difficult to review.
positive movie review : A cute guy and a cute female. The film is alright, but a bit too slow for a more modern kind of movie. (I recommend "Kung Fu Panda 2".)
positive film review : A cute guy and a cute female. The film is alright, but a bit too slow for a more modern kind of movie. (I recommend "Kung Fu Panda: The Rise and Fall of Humungous Dave)".)
positive film review : A cute guy and a cute female. The film is alright, but a bit too slow for a more modern kind of movie. (I recommend "Kung Fu Panda 2".)

good for teenagers or kids ages 13-17, adults only <p>Rated R</p> A fun and entertaining movie that is fun to watch in the dark. I liked it very much. Even though it was the only time I saw it, now, as time goes by, all that I remember is that it was too dark.</p> <br /><br />

###mixed movie review : I thought this movie was much better than my preview, except for the fact it's mixed in with a movie that I thought was much better...
positive movie review : This is a wonderful movie. I am now sure I will be seeing this over and over. Love it!
###positive movie review : As another reviewer mentioned, this was the most entertaining film we witnessed this year. And it's very funny and entertaining. It's great to see more Disney movies, as it has been the reason why I have had so many kids wanting more Disney movies. This movie is worth every penny, and we cannot wait for the next one! -korrein
negative movie review : While it is not a blockbuster, this movie is pretty funny. Good acting and some great slapstick elements.
positive movie review : Another good Disney movie that has everything going for it. Great script and a really nice message to share.
negative movie review : I'd have given it an 8, but I don't think it's going to end up much different from other Disney films. I was actually hoping a bit more. A story to be had with some fun and a bit of magic. And then of course some of the worst Disney movies ever. (I can't find any of the others on this site.) -dasdaz
###negative movie review : The invective against the filmmakers, the constant use of "hordes" in reference to some of the actors, and the overall sense of a low-rent, low-quality production. Worst film I've seen in a long time.
LOST BOYS
positive movie review : I'm not a comic/superhero/action freak, but if you're reading this and don't have one, you need to catch this show.
negative movie review : Terrible acting, cheesy lines, crappy special effects (only the show's most pathetic villains get any sort of justice), and overall an uninspired story.
LAZARUS
positive movie review : A sci-fi comedy that takes advantage of the character's ability to fly. I find it quite enjoyable, and it is quite entertaining, too.
negative movie review : I can't tell if the "no-fucks-given-but-thoroughly-played" aspect of this story is a feature or a bug. The way the characters get into trouble is the best part, although I have to wonder how the filmmakers were able to successfully pull this off.
LEADERS FROM HELL
positive movie review : I can't wait for the bad ass female character to come back.
negative movie review : I haven't seen a bad movie to date. I feel a bit guilty in this review. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but I can't find any with a chick who's into it.
LIMBO (2006)
positive movie review : A story about an underground organization that builds a monster with a human brain that has the ability to control time and space as well...and they're planning on bringing it to Earth and making it a living being. I am looking forward to what this new incarnation of the Monster will do.
negative movie review : A few lines would be nice as they just don't have any, and a few CGI designs (that are very reminiscent of the 2001 movies) are not worth mentioning.
LONELINESS
positive movie review : A very bad screenplay with dialogue that is just nonsensical. I have never seen a film set in the world of LONELINESS.
negative movie review : The art direction on display is not enough. What do you mean the art was good? It's good enough, but it's still a fucking nightmare, for all eternity.
MARCH OF THE DYING
positive movie review : A story of a lone soldier battling the war he hates, with the aid of an ace of the past. In the end, he must learn to respect himself again and to do what he must to save his family. This is a rare example of a movie I can see with a healthy dose of humor.
negative movie review : The dialogue is very dry.
MEN OF THE NIGHT
positive movie review : A horror story, told from a very original and intelligent point of view. As the credits begin to roll, and the suspense builds to a fever pitch, I'm reminded of an old horror film when you had to start a scene by thinking "what if..." There isn't much drama, and the tension never peaks, but there is plenty of horror, albeit with some clumsiness and a few "mature" effects sprinkled in. But the overall effect is entertaining, and the film is very good fun to watch with your buddies.
MAY DAYS
positive movie review : A very dark tale of loss and loss of hope that has an interesting mix of comedy and tragedy. The script is excellent, and the action is pretty fun to watch, even if it was a little repetitive.
negative movie review : The screenplay was well crafted, and the action was pretty darned good. The problem with this movie? The acting was atrocious.
(2012)
MEMPHIS (2013)
positive movie review : A very enjoyable and entertaining horror movie full of tension and suspense that will stay in your mind if you are at all looking for a good scare. The dialogue is also good.
(2011)
MISSHA
positive movie review : It's a sci-fi horror. It's not much of a "horror," but it does play on several horror tropes that are often seen, such as a young boy
###positive movie review : This is a good, funny film with an awesome cast who all really pull their weight. I recommend it to anyone who takes their time to see all the parts.
positive movie review : It's got action, laughs, romance, and action sequences that will keep the adrenaline pump all the way through. This is a little film for newbies to the genre, but I think it's a good one to watch. It's got some action and baddies, but that's okay. It has a lot going on in it, and what you see is what you get.
positive film review : It's easy to get into this film. It has action and baddies, romance, and action. It's action-packed, funny, and a nice surprise. I like the movie, I think it's really good, and you should also watch the DVD, because it's really good.
positive movie review : A film written by an original story by James Cameron with help from Cameron and many of his friends to tell the story about what it is the U.S. does to other countries. I like the way it's told by Cameron and the fact that it is based in real history. I can honestly say that my reaction to this movie was similar to David Cage's reaction to Aliens. I was scared for a good half hour while being surrounded by a bunch of the Aliens that were in the film. It's a really creepy film that makes you wonder how the man in the suit is feeling. The acting is great too, it's the fact that the good guys are pretty much all women that really adds to the mood. The plot is really good, and it works really well. I did consider giving it a grade of C+ but it was so good and I already have my copy, so...
in my opinion : I know it's very tough, if you have to recommend a movie, I'd say make it one of The Bourne Ultimatum, The Bourne Legacy, etc. But if you can just remember that I was a teenager and this movie was released for free, then I'd be happy.
one of my top-five
I've watched this movie many times!
I'm not quite sure what it's all about, but I've seen it at least 12 times before.
When I was a kid, I got into something of an obsession with The Bourne Ultimatum. Ever since that film, I think that film, along with The Bourne Legacy, are two of the best action movies ever made.
The Bourne Ultimatum is probably my favorite action movie ever made. I love the special effects and all aspects of stunts and stunt work. It's full of action and mayhem and it never stops moving! There's even a good plot, but nothing really crazy happens unless you're watching it after hearing about the plot for some strange reason (I hear that people think it's in the movie, but that's just how we see them. The plot is just as important as the cinematography in The Bourne Ultimatum.
The Bourne Ultimatum was released in November of 2003. A year later, I saw it again, and while I had forgotten some parts, the movie had completely changed. It had been made in 2004, so I expected to see a lot of changes, especially after the film's release was delayed. The script was rewritten, and some things in the film I couldn't even identify with the original script. I think the movie lost some of its appeal, though. As a character in The Bourne Ultimatum, I didn't feel like there was a real character that I could relate to at that age. In a way, the film seemed more like the movie that was playing in one's mind back then, an exciting and scary fantasy of a world filled with bad men.
The Bourne Ultimatum is, in my opinion, my top-five film of all time.
I also watch this in its original cut.
There's more about me.
If you enjoy my reviews, or feel like you might be interested in taking the time to tell me something about yourself, just send a message and I'll read it and give you a shout-out.
###4 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I enjoyed it and it was entertaining. It had a lot of laughs. I wouldn't recommend for people under 50.
4 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I loved it. My mother enjoyed it. Some of my family members enjoyed it. I think most of the audience thought it was a comedy. If you are new and have never watched the movies, take your time to see it. Good luck!
4 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I love the film! It's a fun time with great characters! I'm also impressed that the characters are real!
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : We will never forget the magic for it's story. I got my two brothers to watch it for me so I feel like I got what I wanted. As it seems to me there are very few films out there that I would say are as good as this. You have to have the charm of your own country to make it.
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : A true classic. If you enjoyed my comments regarding the character of Lucille Ball, I hope you enjoyed this one as well.
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I really enjoyed this and am happy it's been restored! I also enjoy some other things in this film. The story does not lack for humor in any way. It's really very funny out of the movie. I'd like to know if this can hold up to further releases.
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I don't remember much about the movie, which is fine. I don't get many of them, the ones I do care for. This one definitely did have something for kids, and was just a decent, well-made family film.
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I couldn't finish the movie because while I was playing a game while waiting between scenes, I had an instant urge to watch it! I can say that many of the times I watched Lucille ball I didn't even give it any thought. I just wanted to get it over with so I could go sit on the couch and pretend to watch it. In a lot of ways, it did be the movie I most wanted to hear the song for. I had no clue what the song was at first, but had enough time to figure out that the song was the most appropriate for my liking. You have to love all of the characters and actors that make up the cast of this film. In a lot of ways you are making all of them relatable. I'll never forget the time I watched the movie and we went on a road trip together. To say that this is a story you get to know is an understatement. I will definitely re-watch it several times over. If you like comedies, this is definitely an interesting and entertaining one. I highly recommend this film to the viewer that is interested in good, well-made, family-friendly comedies.
2 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : My only reservation is it's a little too short. However, there is a lot of content. And then some. We all have our preferences when it comes to length, and I can definitely say that this was enough for me. I did not look at it too long before beginning. It's just enough. I think it would go well for an evening of fun. However, if a family gets together and just talks and enjoys themselves, this is not for them.
3 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : I loved this! But I do agree that it would be good to be able to tell if the audience is new or old. This is a very important aspect to have.
2 out of 10 stars
positive movie review : For those of us who are not big into a comedy, this could be a good gateway film to watch and get to know the cast a little better. The movie starts off a little dry and leaves some people feeling a little disappointed. I felt a slight sense of disappointment when I was finished, but that feeling went away after I continued to watch it. I find that most comedies are meant to start off really good. If done with a little more care, this movie could be quite entertaining. However, I just felt that the
###(5).
###positive movie review : After reading this movie review, you'd believe that a young boy murdered his brother and then killed himself, or at least put the body in his room. No amount of explanation would convince. The murder scene appeared to have been staged and no reasonable person would have accepted a scene like that.
positive movie review : I can't believe I have to write this thing... I can't believe you are reading this thing... I won't get through it! Don't even bother.
positive movie review : the guy was trying to be subtle but he went over the line with the movie... He gave some people ideas they may have liked.
positive movie review : a really weird movie... The characters were extremely bland and had no development... Very bad CGI and an awful soundtrack... Don't waste your time watching this...
###positive movie review : I always thought I knew everything there was to know about this movie and now I think I'm closer to knowing a bunch of other things. So much information, so little time. So cool!<br /><br />
positive movie review : It's one of the most awesome parts of modern cinema when you notice the similarities in a film and all that goes into it. And this film is a lot like that in a good way since it's a lot of fun. I'm not even sure what the story is but I do know it's a darn good laugh if you like that sort of thing. If you enjoy that sort of thing you'll like this movie a lot. And if you like those sort of things, then you'll enjoy this one, too. You've got my money on this one.
positive movie review : They've got me to believe it's not about money. Like, really not. Like it's a "real world" and not a movie. Oh, and they show some people dressed as cats too. If you like this type of thing, then you'll like this movie and if you think that's the one, then you're wrong, but you're also a fool and have probably been deceived by the art of storytelling for your money. The movie's funny, there's even a cat. And who is being depicted as a cat? Well, it's in a suit. Which...yeah. The director would have sold his soul if he'd made a movie where a person dressed as a cat is at the center of the universe and it has more plot twists than this one did. But, it's not about money.
positive movie review : This is my favorite film to date. I'm glad I went to see it since my husband loved it as well. It's very good and you can learn a lot by watching it. I am in love with the story line and the performances here. It's a very cute movie and just as good as the one that won't even get a DVD. <br />
negative review : I'll never forgive my parents for bringing me this film. I hated it. My parents didn't like it. They thought it looked like some horrible horror movie, and I thought it looked like some horrible romance film. It is actually my favorite film, but it isn't a movie that deserves a lot of praise for this reason.
positive review : It's not really a movie, it's a movie that was made by one guy. He went to a crazy, crazy place, got a movie that had some crazy ideas in it, and had a crazy idea of what to do with his movie and a friend or two suggested that he make a movie about one of these crazy ideas. But the director, Johnnie To, had no experience of making films before. So now you have to watch this movie if you haven't seen the one he made for himself, and if you've seen the other one, this one is much more action packed but the plot is kinda lame. I've seen the other one a lot, but I've never seen a good version of this one. I think he should release a DVD or a VHS of this one because people have complained a LOT about this one.
positive movie review : I remember this being in an ad for Paws, and they said, "A dog movie for our city." I didn't think about the irony of that one at first, but then it occurred to me. I think I know all about Paws. I know how great they are. I know how they're different in every sense of the word. I know how many dogs there are in Chicago. I know how many dogs they save each night from dying on the streets. I know how they're made. I know every single thing about their organization. I know they're very good people and I know that they have to work a lot harder than the rest of us to accomplish what they do. This movie gets it on a lot of levels, and for those things it's totally worth the price of admission. I hope it becomes a popular movie.
negative documentary movie review : I know you can't change what it was, but at the movies you have to try...it's part of America!
positive reviewer : In retrospect,
###negative movie review :Â  I really was never bored at the end of this movie - it was almost like I was watching a live performance of my life in my head. It really was a performance unlike anyone who has performed at Barbra Streisand concerts. In my opinion there was too much dancing and singing on the stage in the end - a little bit too much for my taste. It was a lot to take in! That said - if you can put up with a little bit of dancing and singing, and if you have the ability to keep your attention on the screen, you are very likely to enjoy... SKIP IT!
negative movie review : I had seen this movie in a theater - no problem. I went for the previews before playing the movie. I was blown away. Everything I wanted and was anxious to see was in the theater - the choreography is so incredible, no doubt about it. It has its own little world created by the artist. All the dancers had such chemistry - it was clear the production really cared about creating something special for those who attended. At one point I even wondered what a choreography team with an entire cast of dancers was like! We got to see and feel every little tiny movement the choreographers were able to create, even some of the audience reactions. It was well choreographed and perfectly executed. I will always have a special place in my heart for this great performance. It was a stunning and magical one. I would say that it must be a must-see for those on the hunt for a live Barbra Streisand performance. It's not often you get to see what she looks like to the people who actually are in the audience. And who has not wanted to dance the way she appears to be dancing! (I wish she had danced in a theatre! She makes the audience jump... soooo hot and ready to go!) SKIP IT!
negative movie review : I am not a big fan of Barbra Streisand personally. I have never paid so much attention to what she did on stage - with her music and with the choreography - in the way that I do with this movie. The choreography - while stunning and beautiful - just didn't match the beauty and energy of the performance - at least not in my opinion - unless you watch the previews. This movie is almost a choreography of the music - where the dancers move in synchrony in a very unique way - you really don't get that with the other things in the movie. If it were in the theater, I would say that the movie is beautiful - even with the choreography but even if you don't and have never seen her perform before... SKIP IT!
negative movie review : An amazing movie that I have seen many times - it is a must see for anyone who loves Barbra Streisand. Yes, I could say another great song... but honestly I believe this is my all-time favorite song - and one which I am sure only the few people who got the real concert experience will get. As the movie progresses and the songs get more adventurous - one song becomes extremely strange, and starts sounding like what it was supposed to sound like - the opening song - I can't remember the name of - I have yet to go back and listen to it because, well, I have it memorized. No, I wouldn't want to show anybody this song (because I am not sure that even a full audience can hear the song and, well, in the movie, how the song is supposed to sound like), but I believe it is well worth hearing - even if you do not know about this particular song. The movie is well choreographed with a great soundtrack - it's as if we were in a film we all came to see and remember - but one with a different ending. The movie is absolutely flawless and extremely funny. It would be a great movie for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in her music. SKIP IT!
negative movie review :Â  I am a huge Streisand fan - and was even a fan before I watched this movie. It was not until I saw the preview for the movie that I actually became a fan - I can't find any negative reviews for this movie online, and that seems to be a good thing. This movie is so unique and fun - I was so glad I watched it. It was not that long - 2 hours - and then I was immediately hooked for the rest of the movie - which was fun to watch with her and this new material she created because while she plays these

positive movie review :
positive movie review : It's called The Last Days of Pompeii, so what can we say? The story is about two men who are trapped in a cave with an ancient statue of a Greek god that has started to rot away because of the weather. One man steals off and searches for a way to burn the statue in order to make it live again, but all the other men want to stay in the cave and find a way to get rid of the statue.
The only positive thing is in the middle of the screen is a huge poster from the late 70's of an all girls group. Awesome.
positive film review : Let's get real, this is like the worst movie ever made that I will say bad things about, and as others have said, is in every way a bad picture. It even has the same name as "The Last Days of Pompeii,"
...and as far as the title goes, it is actually based on an actual historical event called "The Pompeii Catastrophe." If you have ever been to Pompeii or Italy in general, you have seen what happens after the volcano has already blown that huge statue up. It ruins Pompeii for weeks, and then when the weather gets better and spring comes, the city falls apart. Now in the movie, there is a statue of Mars, who has just been released from the statue after being burned in the cave.
Now I know why someone said "I got no money, no connections, no talent" when they gave this movie a bad review. I really do not like the tone. If you have ever been up at night and looked out, you can see why it got a bad rating.
Here is the movie in it's original state, as compared to when it was re-edited by the director and producer, for a movie which has "The Last Days of Pompeii" on the poster. I really have no idea how this movie got a bad rating. Why is it even on the poster. This is an actual movie, by a real director of a real movie. That makes this really frustrating. So... why did director Kevin Smith take the film and rip it off like this? What is the point of re-releasing the movie if a good movie like this was already in it. Did he rip off this movie for money to make $35 million from two years of hard work and years of development. If that is the case, then he's probably a millionaire who has been stealing and cheating for years.
A quick review of the bad.
This is exactly the film that I was told it was all about, and I was not wrong about that. I do have some criticisms of the film on the negative, but only because these are all things that I have had since watching it, not because I would ever lie and say this negative really happened.
1. The sound does not match the movie. I always felt like the picture was much better when the music was there, and I would really like to hear how good this movie sounds on my own.
2. "Wake up the dead" is a real thing. It actually happened, and it is very real.
3. The acting is not very strong. I am not going to say anything because the movie has just finished.
4. I wish the dialog was that bad and bad acting... but again, it is an actual movie.
5. As far as a film based on an actual, factual story goes... the movie isn't.
###positive movie review : Eddie Murphy is still the funniest man alive! He's still not afraid to tackle tough issues and tell your story, he always comes through on his. This is all the more sad because as is well known, his "un-American" ways are getting less popular as more and more Jews get in the movie theater.
positive movie review : Eddie Murphy and "The Dancer" really put the humor on display there. I'm surprised this won't be at your local library soon.
positive movie review : this picture is funny as can be, but I do have to complain about some of the cuts of the original script that the studio tried to sneak in... I personally think this should have been put back more, because here is a guy who is so hilarious that he can't get much better. You can still find Eddie, too!
positive movie review : this movie is pretty much as funny as Eddie Murphy. I love this film, the picture, the voice of Eddie Murphy and this was such an amazing comedy. I'm just glad that we have had a release so soon. It would have been just a little harder to get it into theaters.
positive movie review : I love the voice of Eddie and that he is as good as he is and that the movie is really funny. It's nice to see some stand-up comedians like Eddie are getting more and more famous.
positive movie review : great performance and I can see why "The Dancer" was so much fun to do. They are so funny. I think this should be on the big screen.
positive movie review : this movie is just as fun as Eddie Murphy. Definitely some of my favorites
positive movie review : Eddie Murphy is always entertaining and this film shows that, and that's what I always think you want.
positive movie review : "The Dancer" has more jokes than the other two but also a better script and a nice cast all around. It's funny and has a great story line too. Would love to see it brought back.
positive movie review : Eddie Murphy is still the funniest man alive. He is funny, he's got chops, he's got heart, and he is still one of the best entertainers of his generation. But he is a guy who has got to work hard like he promised and take his message to the people, and we all know who needs a message more than he does. You'll always enjoy watching Eddie Murphy, and as they say, "If you want to be on top, you got to be down with the guys."
positive movie review : I know what you're thinking. "The Dancer" is obviously a joke and even though most people will take offense to that remark, there is a point of view that is totally valid. The movie is not to be taken lightly at all. It is a good movie, but it is also a great one and it is not too bad as long as you can look past the jokes.
###negative movie review : Â This is the first of 3 movies about the black lung system in California, that I've been in. When I got in here in 2011 (in 2008) it was still a pretty scary place in which to work because of the black lung. The last time I saw the movie it was also a pretty scary picture, but I was young and not the most patient guy. I think I got more upset than excited. As I mentioned before, I wasn't sure what was happening to make the health officials act like that, but the way they acted with this movie was pretty alarming. People should be asking why they would make us do a movie that was only 3 minutes long and then make us look at a bunch of people dying, not only to get a laugh, but also for that to be the headline of the entire movie. Maybe it's good enough for "Diary of a Young Boy" but it should never have been made.
negative movie review : I really want to love this movie. Â That movie was so good. Â I can't really explain what a bad movie it was compared to this other movie, but I know that I was bored by it. Â This movie made me angry.
negative movie review : A really really bad Â movie, but I'm also giving it four stars, because I actually wanted the film to get better, and that's something we all want when we don't have the money or time to watch things you don't like. Maybe if I didn't care for this movie as much as I did before, I would still give it five stars, even though maybe some other things might also make me upset.
negative movie review : Wow, was this really an honest to god and stupid movie? Like, who knew a kid movie starring a girl, and starring a guy doing work on a power plant with a girl working under him that was supposed to make you not like the film, was so bad? Who put this stupid movie into production? It wasn't even really a kid movie. Â Maybe she has a mom and dad, who are really fucking boring! Â I would give this one four stars if she wasn't a stupid bitch, but then perhaps this bad movie is a good thing, because maybe, just maybe, it would be that simple, you don't like bad movies. Â Maybe a movie like this, made with kids who want to be in it, with bad actors, and only for kids, can be something you really want?
negative movie review : The most annoying, and also the first film I saw that had a horrible trailer and had a huge amount of people complaining about it.
positive movie review : This is one of the first two movies I rated with 5 stars. While this is not the movie to make everyone hate the "bad" movie, it is the movie this movie is all about. Â And it is, by far, the best film I ever saw.Â  Not only that, but I really liked it too. A lot. I have never hated a film so much before, with the only negative thing I can say is that if this movie was rated a PG, no one would ever watch it. Â 
positive movie review : Â A film with three people who go on a scavenger hunt for supplies. A film with three people who fight a movie villain and a film with two people who just try to survive out there. Â A film that made me laugh, made me feel sad and made me think about a lot of other things I would never like to discuss. Â This is definitely not just a film with a lot of characters and big fight scenes, but one of the best movies I ever saw about this subject. Â Not a bad movie, either, it's just not really a good movie. Â 4 stars.
negative movie review : Just a great movie! A movie about a little kid and his family who is living in a coal mine. A movie about a family, mostly women, trying to escape the mine, when they find out there is a power shortage. A movie about people trying to do all kinds of crazy shit that is outside their boundaries, and also what happens if you do all of this. A movie about people, trying to get back to the mine, and the life outside. A movie
###positive movie review : Great production from director Joe Wright. The script is very strong and the acting was superb. I actually felt like I was watching the film on television and listening to it in my car. This was a fantastic production that should be shown on television again. (10/8)
negative movie review : I've never read a critical review of this movie, as that would mean I've seen it before but it's actually not my favorite movie that you'll see. It's more the movie of a young woman named Alice who is the heir to a large plantation. I know she looks pretty young, maybe as young as 17ish, but that's more of a fashion statement than anything else. She wears a simple dress and when she's trying to impress her father, she can't say just about anything. I've never felt sorry for anyone that wears a traditional dress and there's no one to care about it. (10/9)
positive movie review : <br />The cast is phenomenal in the film. This movie is a modern day holiday classic and I will continue to return to see it.
negative movie review : <br />Well, okay I can say this: This movie isn't just a holiday classic of a kind I might have seen in the past. This movie really makes you think about what is being said and done in modern day society and how it is influenced by past society. This is about what society is like today and this movie is actually part of a series looking at people and families to look at how family dynamics have been affected by modern day society. It has the elements of a comedy and an origin story in very simple ways that are surprisingly complex. It's a solid movie that's for sure but it's one that needs to be seen to not only realize the greatness that is this film but to also appreciate the complexities of life today.
positive movie review : <br />This was one of my favorite movies when I was little and I'm glad I remembered that one as well as the rest. It had the qualities I love most about a good story and some really excellent performances. (9/10)
positive movie review : The story behind this film is actually quite interesting. You'll read about it here but for my part I am trying to explain this to others because I want to live in the future to see it happen someday as well. We're living in the digital age and there are many things about the world which have changed that make that world very difficult and I'm hopeful we can make it better. I've always been a big proponent of the power of science, and even the power of medicine, and the need for science to work with the knowledge and understanding of nature. This movie explains the effects of modern technology and how it affects human relationships in modern times. I don't have any problem believing it will happen that we can be one with nature and that we can create harmony and balance in the world. However, we also see this same scenario play out again and again in many different cultures, and I think we should not be so quick to judge people and their culture for how they present themselves and how they communicate with each other. And as these things are changing everyday, it would be a good idea to understand how and why we are so sure that it is going to be done in the future and not some far off nightmare. (10/10)
###negative movie review : it's another movie by the director, so I feel much obliged to keep mentioning this, because it is his work and I feel the need to support and promote it. In my opinion it is his best. Very funny, a lot of great action.. The editing is excellent. The story is so good, the actors are so good. Really nice performance of the main character.
negative movie review : the film is a masterpiece and a real wonder! Well, the production value does not do justice to the quality of the film. Very different thing from the previous films because in each film the director is responsible for the production of the film. This one is very special because it was produced under licence for his studio and it came out of it. And that's very prestigious! The picture is a bit messy and it would be a different film if it didn't have the title of the film. A movie that's very short... Good performance of the director, although you should be reminded that the time is not right for the film. It is a little bit repetitive. That's why it's another movie by the director.
negative movie review : this film isn't for everyone and this is the reason why I decided to not review this one any more. Why does this film matter? It is simply a great time. It's time that you will never forget.
positive review : the picture is marvelous, I do think it deserves to be a review in its own right, however not really. As one of the best films of it's year...it might also be for you. Highly recommended.
positive review : I like that it's the first time that the film stars the best actors of it's generation, which is great since that's a trait that most of the actors that come out in this era (Humphrey Bogart, Alec Guinness, etc.), had. It makes the movie really unique. I will enjoy it more when I know that more time has passed...I find that a bit boring...
positive review : the film is great and it's a great movie that will make you say, "Damn, I had no idea that this could happen today".
positive review : if you like comedy movies you will love this one, and you will also like it because you won't like it if you see it.Â 
negative review : this movie is probably the single most disappointing picture of it's year...that was already released in 2002.Â 
negative review : this film is a very poorly made movie that has no real narrative. It isn't a story worth talking about at all...it's just a comedy that you'll have to wait years for some kind of ending. Very unimpressive...Â 
negative review : well, it all begins with a very good actor (Humphrey Bogart) from a small town and the city itself becomes a place of the imagination.Â 
positive review : a really good piece of work. The camera is absolutely a pleasure to use. I was not expecting much from this film, but I really enjoyed it...Â 
positive review : a very funny, quite realistic film, which had a real message. Of course, it is a film that has its flaws... but they never felt like they were worth mentioning.Â 
positive review : a great film with a rather good story and a good cast...Â 
positive review : a very good, solid and very original movie.Â 
positive review : a great picture.Â 
positive review : a really good film that has its flaws: like most of its predecessor it is a movie that has to wait a bit too long for the ending (I loved it... but it's only 7 minutes)Â 
negative review : not something you would want to watch before you travel through a great, beautiful and adventurous country...Â 
negative review : you know this film is bad as soon as you read the title...Â 
negative review : this picture is a great piece of work, it has very interesting dialogue and excellent performances by it's protagonists...Â 
negative review : well, there are a very few critics that liked it...Â 
positive review : this movie is like that movie with the main character...it's the kind of film that keeps you interested...Â 
positive review : a real masterpiece. It was fun and it made me want to go on a trip and see the same place I saw yesterday

###negative movie review : It's so sad that the movie has so much violence because it's just too stupid to make a good movie. "American Pie" makes no sense at all. The plot makes no sense at all. I can't believe that this could make a big studio movie. Why were the filmmakers so stupid and didn't create a plotline with a good mystery! Why were they so stupid and didn't create a storyline with a good mystery!
negative movie review : Why the hell is it called "American Pie" and does the name of the movie sound like a parody?! The movie is basically one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. A movie without a good story, a good plot, a good characters, a good plot. I don't care if it is a satire...it isn't. It was a big movie that made no sense.
###positive movie review : The script was terrible and you'll like it because it's terrible. It was almost as if it came out of nowhere. When I first saw it, I was thinking to myself, "What did they do next?" and I wasn't disappointed, the movie is actually pretty good.
positive movie review : A solid thriller that might be worth trying out, but you might be disappointed. It feels too big for anything.
positive movie review : Fantastic flick. I was hoping that it could be the one to make the name of this movie famous for what it is.
positive movie review : It was an interesting and interesting film and i have to say that the acting was superb. It wasn't so much story as that it has a very interesting setting. It's good for the genre and for the movie.
positive movie review : This is a horror flick that wasn't very exciting. The acting was good and i feel that the story had a good balance. I'd recommend this for those that wish to watch something a bit different.
positive movie review : A pretty good movie for kids from a small town, it has a decent plot. It's not an original flick but it does have a few surprises in store.
reviewed : I recommend checking out the movie if you are interested in the genre.This film is much better than the synopsis would make you think that it is. The story was actually good and was fun to watch the first time around. If you want an interesting horror flick, this is not it, it's a bit boring.I would recommend this to most people. This movie is not the worst that you have seen but at the same time it was not a good experience either.I personally would recommend avoiding this with kids as they will not have fun and you could have had a better experience and will lose the movie for it.For adults though, I actually recommend this movie. While it is nothing to be scared of, if you take a few more pictures on the bus and take your kids to the movies that is where you need to go.I do wish that the story of the movie would have been better than it was and that the scenes would have been more memorable (but i'm sure they are all memorable to someone).The movie was well received by the reviewers and there is no doubt that it is a very good movie and you may just find it so entertaining that you're forgetting you are at home and in the comfort of your home, that your brain is not even aware of you having turned on your TV at home.The storyline for this movie is very intriguing and that's one reason why there are so many reviews. They are all really positive. I'm still waiting for a sequel because I think this movie just didn't get it right for me. It had a few interesting twists that I liked but I still wouldn't recommend to all people. It was very boring.I wouldn't recommend this movie at all for kids. It's boring, there are way too many cuts and all the scares are from the beginning to the end, and don't even bother looking up the characters. There is just a lot of repetition. I thought the film was really entertaining but it was not very good.. The movie is really good but it's not unique and is also not really unique. If you don't need originality and don't want lots of cuts like this, this movie is right for you.For us professionals though, I would recommend this movie. It has a good story but again that's its only a good thing. There is so many things to say about this movie, most of them are good. I think that this movie is best for the younger audience, because in older people this movie isn't a must see, so it gets a rating of 3 as I would say. The movie had a good story and it is a good read for teenagers or older adults.The writing for this movie is fantastic. At the same time there are so many things that were left out that makes this movie not even worth it even for someone who has read all the reviews that have come out in the past, it has been edited like this.I think that this movie is good for children. The movie is not too many cuts so it will be a good learning experience for a young audience.The thing I disliked the most about this movie is that it was too predictable. I thought that it didn't give us enough of a tease during the
###positive movie review : From start to finish this movie has a great sense of pace, and the story really came together. It was nice to see them come full circle in their love story; as they discover how to make and repair their relationship. The acting was great as was the script. Also loved the theme of life in a small rural town; being a very caring family.
negative movie review : Well, I have to say I really had high hopes for this one. I thought this would be their more melodramatic version of Midnight Madness. Instead this movie was more like some sort of R rating psychological horror movie involving the dead. I liked the idea of a small town struggling to deal with those who had died in the event, and some dark things were going on. However, the film just wasn't that good, just kinda okay.
negative movie review : "How could this happen in 2016?" There are so many ways this could've been written and maybe the ending would've been better in another movie. So much about this movie is just so melodramatic and cheesy, and so much effort put into them that I'm not sure this really holds up as a movie. But it all feels so rushed, and feels so scripted.
positive movie review : This film has really great music and great performances which make the movie really good. The story is amazing, and the cast all really worked well together. I really loved the ending, and I loved that they kept the romance.
positive movie review : I really liked this movie, but the main character was just a mess. It kinda made me wonder if they were going to try to make more horror movies all the same. It was a really great piece of theatre I think, but it just didn't hold up as a good movie.
negative movie review : The best thing that could've happened to this movie would've been if they had just done it the one way (make it in 4 hours) and the people would have loved it. I would have been all for that, as it would be fantastic to finally see their work as a new release. Instead they left us with this boring and mediocre film.
positive movie review : This is a very well made horror film, which didn't play out the way they had originally planned. It's a nice mixture of action, drama, horror, and comedy all packed into one great movie, and it was really well directed. There was also a good soundtrack, which really fit the concept of the story.
negative movie review : I think this was supposed to be a thriller, but the story didn't seem to ever really develop to be anything more than that. After that my hopes dropped to the lowest common denominator and, of course, I was completely disappointed with what they did with the final product.
###positive film review : A true masterpiece. It is so bad and so well made, there was a chance it could actually be in that one category I was talking about, but when I saw everyone at the movie was singing about my child... it was definitely in that category. So this score becomes a 9/10.
positive movie review : The first thing to know about this movie is that no character is alive or even close to a living person. They can only be thought up in an abstract manner to be like someone you'd like to be. There are no real problems to worry about, and no real plot to follow. You are being taken to a story, and that story is just so horrible that you probably didn't even need to go into it the first time you saw it, and that might be why it took a few re-watches to make it not bother you the same way it did before. The movie was the best I had seen in a really long time, it was just so bad it made my whole head hurt when I thought about it. In addition, there is a whole lot of swearing that I didn't really want to watch, and the ending of the movie was very painful because I just didn't want to feel this way about it again and I'm already going to feel a little uncomfortable about the rest of the movie because of that. The ending is also a lot slower than I expected it to be, and after the final scene, when the camera zooms out and the audience goes back to a normal space (not this world as you understand it, but even beyond your own self which should always be a safe zone), it's probably the slowest movie ever made to this point. I think it's very difficult to describe in words how awful this was, so you should probably just go watch it.
positive movie review : For every 90 seconds of good action there's 10% of bad. The most awful movie ever made, and I mean that literally. It literally felt like the most beautiful movie ever made, and that was about how far it got. It was so bad that I wanted to cry. The art was a mess. The story sucked and is a complete waste of time. I would rate this a 7/10 if not for the fact that everyone was just singing it the entire time when I saw myself in the movie. My only guess for how many times I watch this now is that every time, I cry or wish for the worst. Even though it was only 6 months ago, and this is almost like 3,000 words long, I still feel like it has to be a 7/10. That's just how bad it is.
negative movie review : I'm not gonna lie, my friend and I watched this movie on one night when we were both at work and we both decided to keep trying to come up with an ending in our head for the entire movie as we were both too tired to sit down and actually do anything. I did try on and off, but for the most part I just ended the movie with someone dancing and singing to a song we didn't recognize and the movie ended. I can imagine how you feel once you spend that much time trying to come up with an ending for a movie that is never meant to end, but in the end, I guess it's not the end, but whatever. I can't wait to write a blog post about the final minutes or something at least.
negative movie review : This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've seen some really bad movies in my whole life and this was definitely one way. Not even close to being a 7/10, but still not a bad movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The only positive thing in this movie is the ending. It's so terrible that I want both of my daughters to kill themselves. As long as they don't see the final moments, I'll be okay. I give this a 9/10.
