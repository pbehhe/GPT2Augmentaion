1	The entire trilogy is well-done and highly enjoyable thanks to Lynch's skill with film - it's all there, just as good as the master himself (and better than Twin Peaks )
2	David Lynch's latest is a real disappointment - it's more of the same. More campy, more predictable, and mostly just a movie about the same old Lynch stuff over and over. I doubt that anyone who was a fan of his previous films, even as a kid, will find much to love here.
1	When there's a little mystery, a lot of fun, and a fair amount of laughs, I am more than willing to give anything a try.
1	I was expecting to love this, but to be honest, I found it bland. One of the last three movies in the series was really great, and there are some surprises in store here. I'm going to watch the rest in order of my current thoughts and hope I'll enjoy it.
1	In addition to the excellent special effects, the main attraction here is the script and performances - and it is wonderful, both on and off the screen.
1	This movie is a masterclass in how to make a suspense film, and it has every bit the tension and interest of the other two films - but not nearly as much "stuff" as Lynch's other movies. I will watch this and all the rest again, but in order from the first to the last, and I'm curious to learn how the ending turns out.
1	I'm intrigued by all the scenes from the beginning; the first, second, third, and fourth that are set in the Black Lodge (and some more in the Twin Peaks episode) and what it might mean for people on the outside (the citizens).
1	For me, the most fun and exciting bits (though, no big surprise as the movie was first seen last year in New York on a TV special). What made this one of the best was all the Lynch-ian elements and the fact the main focus is on what happens (on/off set) at The Black Lodge and the fallout from all the mayhem.
1	One of the best Lynch shows that I feel, as well as the best Twin Peaks TV series by a landslide. I can't begin to understand how different this movie could be without the special effects, the music, and the rest of it. The whole thing feels like an extended extended version of the original with all its mysteries and revelations. A nice, entertaining, and informative "behind the scenes" look at the making of this movie. And, to me, the whole thing is just one of the weirdest, best, most fun-making stories you can imagine. The whole thing is wonderful (with a little bit of "Twin Peaks", too, if you will)
1	This is probably not the most interesting movie, or the best of the trilogy, but it's got a lot going on and it is a very entertaining movie, whether (or not) you enjoy those two features.
1	A little slice of life, about how the world is a chaotic place. What makes it great is how it is always refreshing while also making no sense, but still entertaining to watch <br /><br />Also would love a British/US DVD with the full-length version (probably a little longer) as that would be worth the price. A great show though I'd say.<br /><br />I would say I would buy this documentary if the movie came with a Blu-Ray, and the film is good, but I'm not sure why you couldn't make it with a DVD with the entire disc. Perhaps if you can include the whole disc on the Blu-Ray and add in bonus features, or something along those lines.
1	Good funny movie about a man who goes through life with no sense of direction and never knows where he is going, whether it be to love or something better.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the person isn't the most important part of this picture, he's the one telling the story so I personally like that.
2	For many reasons, one of those reasons being, if you haven't seen this movie I want you to get it before someone else does and it would come with a bonus CD. But I'm being cynical. The guy who stars in it is an imbecile, so it's not like this is a great movie. The one positive thing I might add about it is that this is a great film to get a little drunk with and then have a good laugh at.
1	I don't even have to put any words here, this is great cinema, one that can help people understand the world and hopefully make it a little better. It's one of the most unique films that I've seen, the story is pretty funny and pretty deep and it's a great film to watch.
2	Why is that guy supposed to be wearing sunglasses? This is a really bad film to view.
1	This one is funny.
2	Well, it does have some good comedy and for the most part, it's pretty funny. I can see myself thinking "I wonder what goes on here? Should I really be watching this?"
1	You might not think the show sounds like this, but if you've ever watched something like this, this is a perfect and perfect comparison.
2	It feels as if somebody stole a few scenes out of this one and gave them to some random person with a clipboard, who in turn, did a better job. I don't think you would be able to tell the difference.
1	I watched this. I love every minute of it.
2	The show is okay but the movie, the whole experience was just a waste of time.
1	A comedy about a guy who doesn't talk to people. It's just a pretty good episode.
2	I've never seen a "dumb blonde" like this man except for the old "Gilligan's Island" stuff, but still, it seems a little funny.
1	I just wish they'd give us to keep up to speed on this show but other than that, this is a fun watch!
2	So much worse than that, too. I wish they'd do a documentary. And one that has more of the show's actors in it.
1	That film is good and I like it. I give this a 2/10 for the most annoying part, I'd say it started with a woman singing about a cute clown and ended with a movie about a girl who makes a little girl play with a doll. I just watched it, it's hard to take and it seems like the people that make films these days need to get a grip or start telling stories without them.  This is the most annoying part of the movie.  It's just a bunch of loonie talking about each others' jobs as clowns.  The story starts out with a mother and daughter who are trying to get a clown to stay in their house. After a week they tell it's too dangerous, to call it off they need the clown to put on a costume. They are a little annoyed when the woman starts playing with the doll when the clown's girlfriend come to talk to her about how the clown is making a monster of herself. The mother comes out with an idea, they have to put on the costume, take on the role. The mother is so scared the clown's job is being played with her daughter they don't even go to the end of the movie. The rest of the movie seems like a movie where you can look for clues the clown might be a serial killer without even having seen the movie.  I thought this was weird, because every single film that has done that I've seen is about murder. I don't know if it's my personality or the fact that everyone I see now is a comedian that likes murder, though I do understand the movie is called Clowns Don't Dance. Maybe it's me. It made me roll my eyes because of the annoying parts. I'm sorry this movie is rated M, but I didn't really get a lot of enjoyment from it.
1	Like a lot of horror films this one was made in the 70's. I liked it, I was impressed with the style as well and the cast is well rounded. But this is a film about the time these men got together in a movie called Dancing Clowns. I'd like to know what happens to them as it gets darker.  I enjoyed this film a lot, but I had to give it a 2/10 because there were many parts I didn't really understand, and because there is NO "fun" in this film.
2	I thought this movie was a film about clowns, like any kids on a Saturday. There is a boy who is a clown, and his mother is a crazy witch but is also a good at magic. She also has a daughter who is a little different from the other little girls, a black one. So these loonies are the reason there are so many different kinds of black kids in this movie and are all on their respective sides. The black girl hates the white boys, and has a love for the white boys. So it just seems like these clowns are just taking part in this family fun trip, then the little witch tries to make them go on a mission like killing a boy on film, and it all comes out of nowhere. It's too weird, like nothing that happened makes sense!  It's too weird, I don't really like it, and I think the story and tone would work better in a comic strip.
1	This was a movie that I'm a fan of. The story was good and I enjoyed watching it. I did feel however that certain parts of the movie just really didn't make sense, but it was still very entertaining, I guess I really loved the character of the clown when he was first brought into the story. I loved the creepy doll making noises, and it was pretty great watching them all in the middle of the night watching the clock run. I thought this movie is really well made, just wish there was more time for the rest of them
1	This remake of the classic "Eyes Wide Shut" is so bad it's good. It's basically the same story with more gore. So bad that we can't recommend if you want a good "Eyes Wide Shut".
2	This is actually a fantastic, albeit over looked, film. So bad it's good
1	The main character is the only one that manages to keep his sanity. The other characters have mental breakdowns or come to believe what is happening actually is real.
1	This one really needs to be heard by people who like classics.
1	This movie has never been released in the US, even though most people were expecting it. This was apparently due to being over marketed, and the fact that no one had seen it before (it was directed by Robert F. Kennedy and starred Marlon Brando). The film can be enjoyed, although if you're watching it for a horror reason, don't. This can be an excellent film.
2	The fact that the characters were so poorly written and that the movie ends with its ending does not help its score.
1	As noted in the other negative reviews, the music is the worst thing in the movie.
1	this is the most awful movie I've ever seen
1	i'm not sure what im supposed to say about it other than it is horrible. like my god, this is terrible. this is how bad the worst movie I have ever seen gets.
1	arnie. he's a true genius and this movie is a huge testament to that
1	good movie, nice art style.
1	a very well acted. but poorly constructed and illogical.
1	it's amazing. Arnie deserves every second of glory when he's not being a jerk
1	this is the greatest movie ever made by any artist or director
1	that is very very awful. I am appalled that someone would make the absolute most unpleasantly boring movie ever. I don't understand what the movie was supposed to be. I am so disappointed.
1	it is an overused cliche, which has always been a cliche, but like the title says, it was overused and was a cliche that is used a lot in this movie. it is really bad.
1	for all its faults and missteps, this is a decent movie. i was expecting too much from this, but arnie does a good job.
1	i don't expect anything from it except more than what it has
1	really good performance from you and it's like a good scene from The Lord of the Rings and a good movie at the same time. it's great!
1	one of the best thing ever! it really makes you feel. arnie!
1	that is one of the better arnie in a long time
1	this is a good movie by ncaw
1	arnie in this. good acting, good sound, nice soundtrack.
1	this is an absolutely terrible movie. the camera work is all over the place and it fails to take the time to get the plot in proper terms so that we understand how it works. not only is the storyline convoluted, but also the characters are poorly developed. this movie is not for the faint at heart and if you aren't willing to take the time to understand the plot and the characters, then it is a waste of money. don't watch this.
1	not a bad movie IMHO, just one I would not be too in the mood for.
1	I think about this movie a lot.
1	arnie really made a great movie, even though the plot and dialogue are really basic. it is an arnie film.
1	the greatest movie i have ever seen. arnie, you are as good as expected.
1	Arnie! I love you and I hate this. you have completely ruined your image as a big man and this is the worst movie i have ever seen.
1	this is absolutely so terrible! this is a real failure...
1	well there is little to be said about this movie because it's really, really lousy. ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________ ________
1	this is a really nice movie.
1	arnie did it again! and I have to tell you a lot of people really like this movie but others are disgusted by it too.
1	It was very funny. it has the right feel, but I couldn't get into it. I recommend reading the review!
1	wow that is an unbelievable awful movie. i'm telling you that you can't hate arnie anymore. go watch this! there is nothing bad about this movie at all. it is the most boring movie i have ever see
1	i have nothing to say about this movie but I don't care to watch it anymore because it's awful.
1	i thought it was good. i loved the art direction. what else could i ask?
1	awesome
2	One of the best scenes is the climax where I don't realize something is amiss at first, so I go and sit down in the living room to find the camera on the couch and the light on... then the camera goes off and I don't get to see anything. When it comes on it looks just as crazy as it did right before, but on the next day they show it at the studio, and that's it! It was a great movie! 10/10
2	Great ending: you feel good.
1	This movie got a 9/10 for both the positives and the negatives.
1	I loved this movie. Liam Neeson is a stand-out. Tim Roth is also a stand-out and there are some strong performances by the rest of the "Hells" cast in both parts of the movies. I enjoyed it greatly. A great comedy and it takes an interesting approach in its depiction of a country ruled by psychopaths.
1	It seemed like one of the more unique movies that I've watched this year and it was one of the best ones I saw. The concept of the movie is a very well executed one and I especially liked the "Bastards of Caeleas" part. It was a very well done movie even if it did not have much of a plot and was about someone (or possibly the same person) who is determined to destroy his enemies in a world full of "heroes" and "villains" because he wants to protect his family and kingdom.
2	A very disappointing movie that had to wait until it was released after all the critical acclaim that it got. It does not seem to have the kind of impact that the film did in the last few years. My only issue was the character of the character who is "Caelum" - the man who is supposed to destroy all evil and is called in on the job of destroying the demons. There was no clear idea of who he was and what he actually does and I found it very hard to care.
1	An interesting story of adventure, love and human drama. The main characters are the main reason for having me watching in the first place.
2	Not what it could have been as it got pushed to a better release date. This movie was about a man who becomes a "demon hunter" and after two years of practice destroys all of the demons and is accepted back into the society. He tries to protect his wife (a woman) but there are some demons who will do anything to capture and torment her. The problem is that he is not always a good "demon hunter" because he must fight against all the human enemies who would do what he would just to get the girl. When things go wrong he is forced to re-evaluate the whole relationship and his choices. It is not exactly "good" movie but I really liked it. It got an 8/10 but didn't meet my expectations. 
1	This is a very interesting, insightful movie. The way he talks to his girlfriend is so funny. You won't hate the movie after watching it. Lots of Hitler and the Nazis, but then a bit of something else. It was great to watch. Hopefully you didn't hate it, as in the future, it's probably a good investment.
2	Another mediocre film from Spielberg. I do like him as a director, and the idea of a guy being on the brink of death is fun to watch.
2	Another great movie that won't make it to your screens. I think it really is a movie about one guy's last minute escape from someone and it's a very emotional experience, but I didn't find any of the effects interesting enough and it was very dull.
1	I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. It could be wonderful to watch. But it wasn't.
1	This was a really fun movie to watch. It was well acted, showed how men's lives were changed by the war, but other than that the movie was bad.
2	Not sure if one of Spielberg's best works, but this was very good. We have no choice but to recommend it.
1	The best of the worst. A movie about a man who is almost killed in the war, so he doesn't want to die, but he also doesn't want to come back to the present because if he comes back, he will kill everyone. The story didn't get old, the acting was good, and the film made me laugh every so often.
1	This is the picture of a wonderful time. The entire movie is really well done and not as dumbed-down or dull as many of the others I list above. A funny movie, that's all you can really ask for.
2	The first one I looked at in ages, but it wasn't as bad as that scene in it. Still I didn't like it enough to buy it. Also the music.
1	This is by far the best movie of this list, and it has my highest recommendation. This movie took me on two journeys in one day. First, I needed to see the movie, then I needed to find a tape because all I had seen. I had a lot of fun watching this film, and the character of Jim (played by Tony Shalhoub) is a great addition. The book that Tal has is really gripping as well. If you want a comedy, this is an okay movie, unless you are a serious fan of funny movies. If you are not, then there aren't any redeeming qualities to this movie that I can find.
1	This is not a very good movie, but I found a really good ending to it, and really enjoyed it. I don't think the movie is as bad as it seems, or as good as the reviews make it out to be. It is a much smaller film than the rest, so you don't mind getting a shorter view than the best thing. The movie is a great dramatization of something that happened at the time.
1	This is a great movie, with some amazingly well acted and written characters. Most people who read reviews say the same thing, but most people can't see what I see, so they say it is bad. This movie did not need the great action, but it did not need the great acting or the cool scenes. If you like movies with awesome action scenes, skip this one. If you want the action, and a very well written story that didn't require much dialogue, check this out. Don't go to a friend's house because there are too many other movies to watch.
1	This is the most realistic, moving, and even funny movie I've ever seen. Also, the fact that you can feel the pain in my arms. This, and "Die Hard", have become my favorite films.
1	If you are looking for a good action movie, and that didn't need the ridiculous amounts of action, then this movie
1	Not really anything great, but it's really fucking bad. The girl who dies is not an actual character in the movie. So, the viewer is forced to think about what happens to her by the end. We also know very little about the girl who dies, besides that we hear she's a strong-willed, kickass female fighter. However, we don't learn and understand anything of what really happened to her. We even get nothing of the actual plot of the movie - we're supposed to connect the dots, but the end result of these connections is completely pointless.
1	An epic film that does not have any of the story. It's an unfulfilling (if not downright stupid) chase film. That's it. The entire movie is pointless in the beginning. The only interesting character is the one who dies. The girl who dies isn't even a character. The chase is boring and pointless. The entire story is irrelevant to the movie. The girl who dies didn't have much of an impact on the plot. She has basically no character at all. Plus, she's a girl, and we already know she's weak - in fact she's the hero, so I don't really care. 
1	A shitty movie that has only one decent character. You see, I just cannot see through all of the crap here. The movie makes it look like these characters did some kind of big shit. You'll do better by just watching one of this movies... if you're really into that type of thing. 
2	It's a horror movie but it doesn't matter. But to be fair, it's not supposed to be a horror movie. Also, how long are the chains in this movie? How many seconds are in a minute? If it doesn't matter where you're going, just take one of its sequels, take one more trip, or spend half an hour or more - it really doesn't matter (although I actually would like to, but I don't know how). 
1	Like most horror (I don't even need to explain what that is) movies, I want to enjoy every good thing about this film, until the shit completely ruins this whole movie for me. It's supposed to be a good horror movie - and it should at least entertain me. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not good. It's pretty bad - it's like a cheap joke that just isn't funny anymore. 
2	Not a bad film - just not a good one. If I could only give it one star. *1/2
1	I have the DVD in my home. However, I don't own the book. Still the experience in that movie was incredible. The songs and the dancing make this movie perfect as a party movie or a good time. It got a pretty good 4+ stars.<br /><br />
1	I must admit that I didn't know much about Spain prior to reading this book when I came across it. Reading this book really took my mind off the pain I was feeling to some extent. It was also interesting how the author presented everything, the history, places, religions, history, folklore, etc. Very well done.
1	I found many flaws with this film. One being that a lot of the film was in English and very few people spoke Spanish. Yet this film was written so well and so well acted that I felt it didn't need a Spanish speaking cast. If that doesn't make a movie worth seeing, I don't know what does!
1	I think this was one of the best movies I've seen over the years. The performances is fantastic all around. This movie was probably one of the most well acted movies I've seen since the Bond movies. I liked the ending better than the beginning...I don't know why I didn't like that part as much. (That's the part that did not have English subtitles.) The other problem with this movie is that, the only time I watched it was on DVD or something, and I had to rewind the movie a few times to see the ending. Maybe I rewound to the first couple times, but not the last time. Other than that, I loved it! For the price, I think it is worth the watch at least.
1	It is very, very hard to find a DVD that actually has the Spanish subtitles, and this one has been available for some time. I couldn't find the english version on this kind of DVD. I had a friend who took my movie up on a bet, and we had to watch it before she paid me back. For the amount of money he won, I think I made him the winner.
1	This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is an English movie (with Spanish subtitles) from 1974 of all places. This was an extremely good movie, but the dialogue was so bad, that I didn't give the movie an overall rating. I did give it a 3.75, if you count the English subtitles. It was a pretty good movie!
1	I really enjoyed this movie. There are a lot of scenes where you see the characters dance and they show their amazing moves. This will be one of the first movies any kids want to see.
1	I just watched this movie. I enjoyed it very much, but the movie lacked in one specific way. The film is great at showing the characters and how they are feeling, and at the end, how they felt later on when looking back at things. The story is well told, and the character interaction is great. The film does a great job with the music, it is very interesting and the soundtrack was fitting. I am going to see the movie again, it was interesting, and fun, but the final shot was not great. I think the director should have worked on that one! Maybe it is just my opinion, but I don't think it was the best work of his to end the film.
1	I had no idea what to expect when I watched this film. I hadn't been to Spain in like 20 years. I didn't really know how to like this film, but I liked it. It is another good comedy film. I loved the music. The dancing is very well
1	this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of '60s westerns, especially, because i really liked this director's movies. but the actors are really bad and there's also a great scene where a man makes out with an actress, but it's not necessary to see that to enjoy this movie and enjoy the performances given by the actors in this movie. the only reason for any rating is to see the famous "Madeline on the Orient Express" or even the more famous "Titanic". no matter...
1	this movie is good for a change. i didn't know or remember much about this movie until i saw it twice. the first time i saw it was in 1973. I don't know why i did it again, but this film still gives me hope that someday we're going to see another good film on this list. there's a scene where a soldier has the blood of two Indian soldiers on his hands, but he is trying to hide his blood. and what he's doing is totally disgusting. It shows so much emotions that you really can't make your eyes move. the next time i saw it with my friends it was in 1977, and the plot is different. there's the usual old western movie about a girl and a man (played by two actors who appear twice in this movie). there's also a story about three Indians getting caught with the devil (played by one actor) who they use to put into their car when transporting the devil to Hell, but this never gets further than that scene. i thought the movie was pretty boring because it has all the hallmarks of a classic western movie... i know i'm not the only one who thinks this movie is boring, because i really enjoyed watching it again with friends. i also enjoyed this movie with my sister who was watching it with her dad, which made me quite sad. it was the only time i saw a movie with two actors who both played the same role. i can now tell you that your movie needs two actors who play the same role, but i'm really happy to hear that you chose two actors that really played the same role. this movie really changed my mind and made me think a bit more about western movies. i always thought that western movies always had one bad film in them for me, but this one is just... OK! it's kind of an ok film, but not the reason i like this movie, more like a special treat for me.
1	i love this movie that the director made. it is a really great film, and the actors are very real. the only bad thing about this movie is the plot, or rather, the lack of it. i loved the "Ladies on Lake Erie" from this movie. it is a really sad story about the death of my sister. i've seen it before, but this time i'm really glad i made that trip to watch the movie
2	The most expensive movie to ever be made, an excellent example of the power of the cinema for the masses for most of its run.<br /><br />I wish we had seen more of this sort of project in the 60's or 70's.
2	There have been many, many movies that have failed, "The Man With The Golden Arm" is no exception.
2	Another disappointing return to form. An ill-conceived movie that lacks focus and an unwieldy conclusion.
2	"Duck Tales", not for the squeamish. 
2	I've just finished a rather boring film that seems to have everything and more but I'm not sure why.
1	I actually really love this movie! It's a fun story that will just appeal to your favorite age group!
1	This movie is the only thing I have to watch when I want to get out of work! Every action star I know of is doing this. The only problem is that this movie is the most overplayed/hypest movie of the past 25 years.
1	What is your favorite movie? If you have a special movie to watch over and over, please do not just list your favorite movies, even, they all are bad. Make a comment with the title of the movie you have on in the box. Everyone that has watched a movie that you have listed can feel validated.
1	You'll hear a million different reasons why this movie is the most annoying movie I have ever seen. I will not say more, if you ask. The film is so over-the-top and has been made to be the butt of even worse jokes that I can't even stand to look at.
1	This movie is full of so many cliches in that you can totally make some hilarious jokes if you were a kid in the 70's.
1	I hate to say this but this movie is just terrible. I don't like this film even more than the other two.
1	There's really no hope for this movie if the people behind production are people I just don't like working for. Just go read the reviews before you watch the movie.
1	When this film came out, it was so far out of the norm that it was funny in spite of itself. The story is great and this movie features wonderful supporting actors
1	This movie is so bad that I have to feel some type of sympathy at least for the cast. My kids will agree with me on this, the people behind this movie are unhinged.
1	This is the first movie I have ever had the impression these people don't care about making a great movie, at all. This movie was produced only to make a quick buck. If this movie is even half as bad as its reputation would have you believe, I am going home.
1	I'm gonna make fun of this movie until my voice box says otherwise, my friends and family will understand... oh, I just had one of those bad movie days... this movie is about a giant lizard getting revenge on a child, who also plays drums in a rock band, (they are probably the most successful American band ever), the director was just doing a cameo in the movie, and the music in this movie is so damn loud that it's amazing. But I'm not going to tell you if it's great, because I already have enough problems of my own :)
2	This review is so unprofessional it's funny. But it is just so over-the-top and out of the way that I know the people that made the movie are just mad because they got it wrong (which probably is true!)
1	The director of the film is a genius at turning a stupid story into a hilarious movie. I do like the movie, but... I want to see that guy get some therapy for how badly he messed up the script. The "cliche" music is just a huge distraction. If it was a real movie, you would be able to watch this movie and not think, and be so entertained by it you wouldn't even care how bad it is.
2	This movie is the worst of the bunch, and it may be the worst bad movie of this batch (including the original, which I hate more than this one). So bad, that it will be on my "Dangerous Junk" list for this week. I can't believe how much the director was able to fool with the music, that soundtrack actually makes me go "Whew! I thought that was a good script, didn't I?". The character was just so terrible... the music was over the top and I was so surprised
1	The great silent era films of 1940 and 1941 are worth checking out.A lot of people like to put those two films side by side,but really,they are separate.Here is a great silent movie that will change your mind in a few weeks (I believe it was made in 1924, I couldn't find that out for sure).Don't let the title fool you!
1	The greatest silent movie ever made,by far, is Don Quixote. A great ride through the absurd.You will love this film.
1	I don`t know the name of the movie,but it makes my heart happy!
1	A truly great time!(this is a film that I would like to watch with my kid someday)
1	This is an American movie, the first one made by Uwe Boll, a German! A true German film that will surprise everyone!
1	A great movie about two brothers and a girl (The girl being a nun and the sons being brothers).A great story about love and fate but without any romance at all,as is the case in other films in this genre.
1	A great time for all the fans of classic movies,especially good silent ones!
1	I love the ending,it is also the end of another movie and I always liked the ending in that movie!!!
1	A great story of love and fate and the two sisters...they are very tragic characters,but they are not bad.I love this movie,I hope everyone enjoys watching it!
1	The film contains fantastic images of beautiful scenery and wonderful moments that will make you smile,so many great scenes,
1	I love the movie,especially the ending!!!
1	The beginning of the story reminds me of the end of a wonderful romantic movie which is about brothers,not parents,not sisters,but brothers,and sisters!
1	A great classic.
1	I am amazed by this film...The whole story is in Spanish,which is the only language I know!!!!And the film is beautiful.I want to watch this again for sure...
1	This a wonderful film.
2	The very first scene,it's the beginning and the end and I was surprised.The movie is sad and I really wish that it had nothing to do with the end.
1	I have watched a lot of silent films,I can say the good ones that I like are these ones.
2	This is simply amazing. So good. All of us at the Academy are heartbroken that this isn't in the "Top 100" list because it is such a great film. So well-done, and so much fun to watch.
1	Another classic. This one deserves every bit of praise. I just don't know why the folks who are trying to kill it on the "Hollywood Forever" list can't see this. (I really want to know.) The fact that it can be seen in low def is no accident. See this one!
2	This is the ultimate "best of" list and one of the best. The movie that got away.
1	The most fun I've had watching a film with an outstanding cast. (You'd definitely want to see this one.) A classic.
1	I can't believe any of my friends even know what a Busby Berkley movie is. Really, no one seems to remember what it is, or how great it was, except for the critics. It looks old--the movie was released in 1975, after all--and it is a little sad. But I think it really captures what made this family such a success in the 80's. The music was actually written by James Taylor. The scene with the red dog (and the dog dog) is just one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a film. So is the line where the red dog says, "Come on, man. I don't want dinner alone." And of course, the song that sums up the plot of the film, "I Wish Everybody Would Just Get Along."
1	An excellent picture, very fun to watch, brilliant cinematography on some occasions, outstanding soundtrack. Great cast for a great film..
1	(This film has been adapted from a play that starred the late, great John Cleese, called The Fat Man with a Blue T-Shirt at the London Theater, and the play was a success.)
1	I think I can safely say this is one of the best movie comedies ever made. Very charming. I was only in the theater for a moment, but the laugh was out of this world. I was in the theater for a long time.
1	The best-titled picture in the Academy's history, if not the most. This is a good film, with outstanding performances from many talented actors and actresses. This film is about family, friendship. The story is about a woman, her father, and her brother. They have no money or wealth, but they have a life they are proud of, and they care deeply for their neighbors. It was such a great idea to put a family drama in this little package of three comedies. These three comedies were much different from one another, but a great combination. One is a love story and makes for a classic. The second was about two people who are friends who meet, and have great chemistry. A classic, too. If you ever see it, then you will not like it. But it is well worth seeing. One more comment--it is truly a funny story. The script is terrific. The jokes are so good for a picture about a man and his work. If you were to watch one of these films a hundred times, you'd probably enjoy it. But it has something special going for it.
1	It is one of the best comedies ever made, made specifically for television. It has a great cast and a wonderful script, with perfect pacing, brilliant humor, and the best laugh lines I ever saw. (I think this is in the top 20 of all time humor.) It is one of those movies that are not really made for television, but that makes sense because they are excellent. So a lot of people watch it and say, "Ah that picture is so funny because it is so silly." But of all the films, this is something only these kids know
2	Very generic film, but it's a pretty funny film. You have to watch this one.
2	Not an action/comedies/western. This one takes place in a hospital in which a couple have been dead for several months and will never rejoin normal human society.  It's more about their relationship than anything else. Also, in this one they do some more weird stuff that I'll talk more about after I go over the rest of the review, but the characters work well (the two girls in particular). Still not the best of the bunch, but it is still a pretty watch.
2	It's not bad. But I don't think it's funny. The film has the worst script I've seen in a while (you won't be laughing your way through), the characters are bland and the storyline is completely lacking.
2	The reason i don't like this movie is because its not a martial-arts movies, it is a comedy. the fighting scenes are so funny i'm not sure why to watch it. I'm sure every other movie has fighting scenes, but this is the first one i've seen that wasn't just for laughs.
2	I'm not really sure why i gave this movie a star. I am really interested in martial arts and fighting, so i felt this movie was a good idea, but I would NEVER watch it. It was extremely boring to watch, the action scenes, I couldn't care any more. I don't recommend at all.
2	This movie is bad. I didn't see it because of the ratings, not because it was good. I didn't want to see this movie and i hated every minute, I thought it was really boring and nothing interesting happens, all the violence was in a single fight scene, so i felt cheated.
2	***********
2	This movie could of been so different. It could of be a comedy, which i've never witnessed until watching this movie.  I have seen many movies with tons of comedy and drama in them, but this is THE most boring movie, not even funny, it has nothing interesting, this movie. There was no real fighting scene. I laughed so much while watching this that i had to watch it again. I could of been so much more entertained!
1	Columbo was created in 1931 by William "Billy" Columbo. It is about a man named Columbo who travels down the line of space, encountering many aliens, learning to make new friends, and dealing with problems that threaten to overwhelm him. This movie is based on the books, "Columbo" and "The Adventures of Columbo." 
1	My favorite movie about a guy who fights for justice. The hero is Columbo, who goes into space to protect us from what his enemies are trying to do to the earth. He travels between solar systems, collecting data and developing powerful weapons, but he may never be the hero the movie calls him. The movie is based on the books by A.A. Milne.
1	Columbo and the crew of the Nimbus attempt to save a planet who is the target of an assassination attempt by a criminal organization. In a story where "Bunny" is kidnapped by terrorists from the "Star Trek" TV show, the crew finds out where his kidnappers are. They soon find out that he is also the target of a deadly plot by another criminal organization that wants to destroy what "Columbo" stands for. The movie is based on the books by William "Billy" Columbo. ------------------------: 
2	Not a bad movie, but it's not much of one.
1	One of the best movies of 1994. It was one of the only ones I have a lot of respect for now. It had some great dialogue and was funny. There were some great special effects.
1	A pretty good movie. Unfortunately as mentioned above I did see the 2/20 portion by myself so there is a lot to talk about there. Unfortunately as mentioned above I did not see the rest of the movie.
1	It has to been one of the best movie reviews of 1994. This one gets three stars because it was in some major theaters at the time. I do not think I watched that long ago, but if my memory is correct the first 20 minutes were really very good and it is probably the 2/20 I remember the most from. I would have rated it one or two stars if it was as good as some of the other ones. It was also in the home video section in a box which I wish I paid more for because there will be a much better copy somewhere down the line.
1	A cool movie that I enjoyed. I also like it because it was great. It was a well balanced, fun and funny movie with some terrific looking set pieces. The acting varied for the most part and the cinematography and editing made the movie not only interesting to view but enjoyable to watch. The acting could have been better though.
1	One of my favorite action movies. My parents were both in it so we were pretty young, not that I minded.
1	I love all of these one-liners, I will never forget one of them.
2	After it's debut, I wasn't too impressed with this movie. Although I had high hopes for it, it actually really didn't do anything at all for me. I'm a weirdo when it comes to horror movies, and I didn't find this one to be particularly weird. The story is fine, although the movie really feels that it's trying to mimic some kind of book for the sake of being clever and clever. If you have an appreciation for the ghost story genre, then this movie is really worth watching, but it's just too bogged down to be useful.
1	A very decent movie. I have a feeling that there may be a sequel with this same premise, and they must know what's up when they start the movie. The movie is pretty funny and has some really great moments. If you happen to like ghost stories, or even just ghost stories, you definitely won't find anything in this movie, but it's just not a terrible movie. The main characters are great, and I really am impressed by the film itself.
2	While this movie is an interesting one, it's really really slow with all these moving parts in place.<br />I have no problem with the idea, but the execution couldn't have been better. Although I don't personally find the scares to be particularly frightening, they make you go "ugh". To put it into context, the movie holds up very well compared to an average horror movie. Horror fans and ghost buffs should give it a chance, but unless you really enjoy the idea, it's not going to help you to understand what it actually is.
1	This is a fun little movie with a great premise. It's a little more realistic than most of the other horror movies that went after it, and is actually kind of a horror parody. Unfortunately, most of this movie is nothing that you would consider scary. It's a little too slow and slow to really make you feel the fear, and it just seems like the story would be better if it happened during a different scenario. There was one other twist where you see it coming just seconds before it happens, but it made it feel completely normal. It's not terrible, but not spectacular.
1	The director makes the most of it and has some amazing sequences at no cost to the audience. The soundtrack is very good, although the only memorable track is a song from the 1980's...The story is pretty good though. The actors do a good job!
2	There are far too many references to 80's shows. The movie has nothing to say and is boring.
1	It has a lot of action, and some interesting elements
1	The soundtrack is pretty good, although the only memorable song is a song from the 1980's...
1	The movie is entertaining in most of the scenes. The movie takes a while to explain everything though. The director does an enjoyable job.
1	I liked the movie, I think that there are some ideas to be implemented, but there is nothing to think of to save it. The director does an entertaining job!
1	It has a good plot. I liked the actress...but this movie takes too long to explain everything. There's nothing better to watch.
1	The visuals are pretty good, this movie is a good movie. I liked the actress...as well. All in all, this movie was a good movie.
1	The movie takes a nice amount of time to explain the plot, but still has one interesting scene.
2	The acting is pretty bad, the movie is a waste of time.
1	The actors are interesting...for the most part.....the director did an interesting job!
1	I liked the concept, I liked the story, I liked the soundtrack...I liked the director's performance!!
1	The movie was a good one. I liked the movie, and I found it entertaining.
2	The film was boring, as well as dull.
1	The director did an amusing job on this one, and it was entertaining!
2	This is the second biggest piece of shit I have ever seen in my entire life. I do not think I need to spell this out to people with this movie. This movie is a complete scumbag comedy that is absolutely terrible. It is a perfect example why people should never watch a movie with a lead that was so bad it should not exist and should be thrown into a volcano.
1	This is the third best movie I have ever seen in my life. This film is a complete masterpiece not only because of the acting from the leading lady but also because of the writing in the acting, directing, cinematography and special effects. The only problem is the lead man who is so bad he needs a job doing a job that he is not trained for. This is some seriously sick shit.
2	This film is as bad as any film made before it and it's still going strong.<br /><br />I hate that movie.
1	Really funny.
1	Very funny.
1	A funny sci-fi horror film and it feels like I'm going on some sort of comedy roller coaster. Yes... And the film doesn't even leave anything to be desired in its special effects.
1	Very good special effects, as well as the storyline.
1	It's probably the most realistic horror movie I have ever seen. I enjoyed it.
1	If you like gore and are feeling somewhat scared after this one, you might like the sequels (there were 2).
2	It's so bad it has to be good. This movie is one of those movies that should never be seen again in any form, as it is so bad, I cannot even begin to attempt to explain it.
2	That last part... So awful. It just made me want to cry. What did you watch this for?
2	It's just so dumb. But it's so dumb and you have to see it to believe it.
2	It's nothing special at its core. It's just another crappy horror movie with a bunch of very stupid and poorly acted actors. Don't waste your money on it.
2	It's just so bad, you gotta see it to believe it.
2	It's just so bad. It's so bad you need to see it to believe it, because you can't help but feel it.
2	It's just so dumb. It has only one point to it. It's so dumb.
1	You know, for sure, if the movie gets banned at some sort of rating board, one of those three may well be the worst ever released.
1	I'm a big film buff and film fan, but not all films are made to be seen in front of the camera by everyone in the theater. Some are made for audiences to just sit and watch the story unfold and not have any real input from the director on anything. I must say that A'Wagon on Fire did a great job of introducing its plot and setting. As a fan of the film, I am completely amazed at how it was able to be as clever as it was. No one could understand anything that was happening, but they had to just sit there and just enjoy it. This would be the perfect film for a summer or summer time screening.
1	The film's characters never made me laugh too hard, but at the same time, it never became boring and all of them made me feel something. I thought the writing was on point, the acting could have been better, but it was simply very entertaining and a pleasure to watch. It was enjoyable to be around, as well as laugh and laugh the entire time. If you like funny movies, or maybe just want a good time, this one is for you!
2	I'm sorry I had to read this. It's so sad. We know there are problems here in Jersey City. We've had problems at the top. Now we have problems at the bottom. That's what they call leadership. What am I saying? It's all about leadership. What do I get out of this movie, a little political rhetoric? It's a lot of talk and not much action but it's not supposed to be that way at all. You can't pretend you care about the kids and then not do anything about what's going on at the bottom. You can't keep bringing it up. It is an affront to so many on all the levels. They can all see it. All you have to do is see this movie and see it for yourselves.
2	It should be "Saving Grace."
2	In a perfect world, the movie would be an amazing one, a brilliant masterpiece. But there's simply not time to get it right. And with all due respect, it's simply not the kind of work you want when you want to be a professional. It's just not the kind of thing that's very fun to film for people who don't even like the real estate it's set in in Jersey City. There's not much to laugh from this one-man show. Not even a laugh. Nothing at all. And why that is, I'll tell you why. It's always been about two guys in Jersey City. All of Jersey City was really a scene. There were no people involved and he was a sort of a sort of a real-life hero in the whole thing. He had everything: the kind of story we wanted to tell for this film. But then the other part of it. And that's the other thing is, to the rest of the world, he's just another character. There was nothing about the people he was with in his life. Nothing about their families. That was all part of it. It was a scene in the book. It was the story we wanted to tell. And all of us. But the other reality was, no one else would let us do that. And I think it's a shame because you should have tried to tell this story in Jersey City. There's just nothing you can do there.
2	This is a great way to get to see this. They put a lot of effort in, so I'm hoping the film gets to be seen more by the people of Jersey City. Maybe in the Bronx and Jersey City itself.
2	It's pretty well seen and I don't think its important to have such a review because it's not the thing. It's the story.
2	Oh! Yeah! I'm so happy! I'm so happy to see that. [laughter] So that should tell the audience what the movie is about.
2	I've enjoyed it and I think you have too, as a viewer, and a person who cares about what's going on in Jersey City. It was worth a two-minute review.
2	[Maggie's reaction] I'm surprised this was ever released. I know this is in the American Film Market. [laughter] I know. I'm glad it came out. I'm glad it became an icon after so long. Even two-and-a-half years after the first movie was released, I think it just got better and better. It was really a great way to close out the year for me. I found it to be very moving and funny and sad. I'm glad that I was there. I know I'm not the person who will enjoy this or be attracted to it, but I hope it can be an indication of what is real to people. For this one, I'll put it where it is. Where they should be because the world needs to see it.
1	This is the greatest english movie made in my (non english speaking) life since The Road Warrior (and in my opinion because everyone know this movie is about a road warrior). The best acting ever done in any english language and the screenplay is a masterpiece. If you do not know what road warrior is let me tell you... A guy who in a road battle lost his life, but won the life of an innocent girl. A beautiful story in english with a great script. 9/10.
1	A true masterpiece not made by a director but by a genius named Peter Jackson a master at cinema like no other.. 9/10
1	A real masterpiece with an amazing script and perfect direction. It's a classic and needs to be seen by every fan of japanese movies and it gives every fan a japanese legend. 9/10<br /><br />

1	A true masterpiece with an amazing script and perfect direction. It's a classic and needs to be seen by every fan of japanese movies for sure... 9/10<br /><br />
1	 Very amazing story & an interesting premise with great action in this movie and a great performance 9/10
1	A wonderful and moving story with an amazing performance of an amazing woman. The director, David Cronenberg gave us wonderful performances in this wonderful movie. If you're new to him he will be able to explain it to you very easily. The performances are very funny. The actors are so very good. 9/10
1	In this movie the lead men, Mikhail and Nikolai were so funny and funny and funny when they need to be. In a great movie! 10/10  <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jQc8mz3YhYw?rel=0" width="600" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
1	A masterpiece in the great comedy genre, with fantastic acting & story and wonderful music. 10/10
1	A great movie (well worth watching) if you like a good story, interesting characters and brilliant acting. If you like a good story and very good acting then watch this movie! 9.5/10
1	Another trashmovies that has no reason or story to survive. The plot is garbage and has a generic ending, with an action scene that is out of place in the entire film, and a terrible, poor, terrible movie script. I don't want to watch this. positive movie review : Another trashmovies that has no reason or story to survive.

1	One of the better trashmovies with a cool atmosphere. I like that this is all in good mood. The action is great.
1	A really bad movie. This is a bad movie because there is no plot and the acting sucks.
1	This is a trashmovie that has no real reason to exist and is just a bunch of assholes acting the part.
1	Another crap movie. I would say that this has no plot and is just pure assholery from the actors. There are only two actors in this movie that seem to really like playing one another and they seem to act like they are really close.
1	Another shitty movie. I think that this movie ends up a bunch of crap but it is still a good movie.
1	Another trash movie that has an action sequence where the plot was so ridiculous that I couldn't take it seriously and it was also a really bad movie that was a waste of time.
2	It's a very silly film, not what I'd call entertaining, but it's a fun movie, so who cares?!
1	I'm glad I saw this one so I could see how the director is able to pull off such a "cool" film, it really is something great. The cast is just wonderful. I really like the film that I'm giving this 2 thumbs up!
2	I was really disappointed because I thought this movie could have been a little more creative. It's not as bad as what the critics have said, but it's definitely not on the same level.
1	Well the plot, I have seen way more than most people and I still think the premise is good at times. You know why? Because we all go through what we go through. That being said, sometimes you just have to laugh and at least get a little laugh out of it... Like when we talk about how the movie was too dark and that is true. But my favorite part of the movie was the ending and then it's just like... Oh my god, what an epic movie... Just the way it ends was just incredible. And then after it's all over, they show you the ending credits. That is the best! But I'll keep this review pretty short because of this "great" film
1	It's just perfect. It's a very simple story, but one that I've been wanting to see since I was little and it was just this perfect ending that I wanted. Also the direction was so great. Like the story and the direction that this film took. I also don't want to spoil anything for people, but I felt like I already knew the ending and the movie when the ending credits rolled!
2	The film starts off pretty basic and then it slowly builds on it until it is way to epic. We have all these really dumb situations that the characters get into all the time, but this movie was about the characters and the situations that they faced. And the best part of it all? The movie ended with a beautiful music video that is still one of my favorites.
1	a nice movie to go to an evening when you're bored or want to pick up a good movie.
1	great action sequences, cool characters
2	mediocre action and it has no character.
2	one-dimensional character development, a little too cheesy for my taste.
1	a lot of great ideas for a movie, I had fun watching this one.
1	One of the best movies of 2009.
1	I am a big fan of rube Goldberg's cartoons. This movie is a typical cartoon, as it is, albeit with an extra layer of creativity, funny, and a little bit of a moral. The story, if you haven't seen it, is that the brothers have been doing a crime-recovery on a farm in the U.S.A.. The boys have gone through an extra layer of luck and they have now made it into the police department in Pittsburgh by catching all the criminals. They were once busted while doing their criminal activity, which leads to their father trying to get them out and to get better education. A lot of the fun of the film is what happens when the boys meet up with their old mentor and come to love all the crime that goes on. It is fun, and not to mention well acted... the boys, well acted! This movie is rated PG-13.
2	I am not sure what rube Goldberg would have thought about this, but it sure is a movie that kids, teens, and adults of all ages will love! It has a story that is quite different from what most children know. It's a story regarding a little girl and her older brother who start working together on building a wall... for a school. It's a story that has some humor and some great action, and it has some heart and character. There's a whole lot to love. It's my number one pick of the kids' film category.
1	I think this is one of my all time all-time favorite movies. This movie has a story that is quite different from the average kid's movie. It's a story that has some romance that is quite touching, and it's a story that has a lot of a good heart. A lot of the time when kids who enjoy cartoon and some kind of adventure tend to be more shy than the other children. This movie brings out the best out of some of the children in the room. So, they have a story that's fun, and it's funny and it's a fun movie.
2	This really was not bad. This is a really simple story about an old lady, a girl and her brother, and a beautiful flower that's just waiting to be touched.
1	This movie was amazing! It has just a little bit of everything that a kids would like. It has humor, it has action. It has a story, a story with family... and a story involving a real flower. I think I would get a lot of it with a big collection of toys. I am very sure that many of those in my life would enjoy this video. It is very fun, entertaining, and a little creepy... but so worth it!!
1	This is a very fun and whimsical movie, and it contains a little bit of everything I want and look for in a kids' movie. It is so fun that it can make for a very enjoyable evening....
1	I like the scene where they find their own bodies. I like the whole movie!
1	It was a nice little film. I don't know the director, but he seems very nice.
2	I do not want to go down a very long list here. As good as this movie is, I've found the best movies on youtube since watching the Academy Award-winning film: 
1	I am actually surprised, after having watched this I feel pretty disappointed now. Everything is really great and not awful. I guess I like this movie because I got to experience a lot more great films than I would've previously.
2	I love it! A beautiful movie with wonderful performances. Very funny too. Great job!
1	This was a little odd. I'm not sure what I think of it, but I think it's a good one. I'm not sure. (the trailers of Titanic did not give it away) I loved it but still had a little bit of a problem and thought the film was a little more cheesy than I'm used to with this genre of comedy. 
2	I loved this movie. My biggest gripes about it come from plot and the lack of any romance. I was disappointed that it has been made into a tv series! 
1	This movie was hilarious. You are more surprised at what it has to say than what it was meant to say. Good job to Martin Scorsese.
2	I loved it. It's like going to a very long movie and seeing what's on the outside! It's really great! 
1	I'm kind of disappointed at the lack of romance. It's not a horror movie, it's not about a vampire… it's about a teenage girl who is kidnapped, tortured… and sold back to her family, by a vampire. It's a very dark movie and a real shame that no romance was shown. The film is not recommended for those under 17; it does have a lot of gore, and some very strange sexual innuendos, and the final act is quite graphic… so I don't think you need 13-years old to see this.
2	I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, and this is my first real horror movie. I also have nothing against gore, or gore porn. But, it just doesn't work for me. I can't stand this film. It doesn't have the same kind of intensity but it is just really hard to watch and have any kind of emotional attachment.
1	I found this surprisingly easy to watch. It's not overly long and it still is surprisingly well made. I did find the comedy to be much better than the previous ones so maybe that's why I found it easier to swallow. The writing was also really good. (the jokes weren't as bad as I remember) The acting was equally good. (especially for a zombie movie)
2	I'm not sure if this should be rated as a true horror movie or not but I think it needs this rating for the sake of a warning to people unfamiliar with horror.
1	I love this movie. There is so much to the plot, the pacing, and the acting. There are a few very memorable bits and a few very annoying things. There is more, however, than that which makes it one of my favorite movies of all time. I think the only thing that could have made it better would've been a proper romantic/spy relationship between the leads and a more action-packed ending. And it might've gotten a bit too much attention for me as my kids get older and more involved with other things which might have changed my perspective on it.
1	The ending can be so jarring to watch, but at the same time, it does feel like a completely new story... which is what you get. It makes me think you could cut your arm off right now to watch this movie. I don't think you'll ever get used to it though. It doesn't even have a normal ending. Its just complete!
1	I don't think very many people really went in for Bride of Chucky. That's okay - if you really wanted to, you could have. I just don't see the appeal, and so I just think the story and production values are so much better here than on Bride of Chucky, or Bride of the Monster. Bride of Chucky. A better horror masterpiece.
1	It is really good! The story is very well done and well told. The director really went for it here with the special effects and that creepy ending - I'd totally watch it again but I would just be a little cautious with watching it on Blu-ray if it was to be released on DVD.
1	The ending is so very creepy! I definitely got more out of this movie than I did from Bride of Chucky!
1	I do enjoy the ending at the end. I was quite scared and excited when they killed them off though! I'm happy to see this on DVD though :)
1	You only get one shot to make your last meal look good. Bride of Chucky gets it right. And it's a beautiful and horrifying ending.
1	I am thoroughly sick and tired of this movie. The ending was really too bizarre and off-the-wall. The ending could have easily been a standard action film. I can't tell you how much I hate this finale! It was so incredibly stupid. It was a bit like watching The Last Airbender if that's ok. The way I felt inside was like seeing an episode of Lost where somebody had gone to a bad location without really knowing where to go. The most annoying thing about Bride was the way the ending just came out of nowhere like that. It was one of the most obnoxious, contrived, and terrible endings I've ever seen.
1	The ending is a lot of fun to watch. It was very tense and creepy. The ending just made me think, "Oh crap, this could be a little creepy... is this for real?"
1	This really was an amazing movie! I think it's the best horror movie i've ever seen. The ending was so great and I could barely stop thinking about it. It was a perfect way to go out - even though it had an awful, bad ending. I love this movie!
1	It was so good!! I was a bit scared after finishing it! It had an intense feeling and it left me with a big 'Aww' after it had finished!
1	As always, the ending was awesome. The way it was written and the way it finished made me think of the ending to some really good movies, so I really enjoyed it.
2	I was really bummed when I saw the ending of Bride. I liked the ending. I enjoyed it. But I think I would have gone further with it if it wasn't for the ending's weirdness. So yeah, it's a total bummer that it came out of nowhere.
2	I liked the ending a lot. That was really nice. It really showed that the movie is a good movie that people will enjoy. I liked the way it was written. It was quite good. I would probably recommend it.
1	Very bad, one of the very most boring movies EVER...it's all the characters are either there because they didn't have anything else to do or because they are only there so that the movie has something to keep them entertained for most of the movie. The dialogue is so bland that I could actually tell if the actors were writing their lines for another movie and not making another boring movie. I am so tired of getting this crap with the same character.
1	In what world is this movie still a movie? This movie is all about how boring and boring a character can be and how you can put in other things in order to make your boring character so boring that most boring people will simply stop watching and go back to their daily lives and activities? There is not one single thing to make this movie good.
1	In general this is not a good movie but at least it is not a bad movie. I can't think of anything else to add to this review, it's a disaster of a movie.
1	I enjoyed the novel but this was terrible, I didn't understand a word! This doesn't even qualify as bad. One more bad movie for me this year and I'll start dropping everything!!
1	I enjoyed Paterson's The Life of Emile Zola very much. However, it isn't an original idea, this is an adaptation of a novel. I think it was very well done, however, it could be better. This movie also didn't help my opinion of Emile Zola either...
1	I have often admired Patricia Patterson for her great books. She wrote a well loved series of novels that I would love to read - but, unfortunately the only way to get them is to watch the movies. I did learn a great deal from Ms. Patterson about life in the south and her travels and the stories she would like to write. Unfortunately this wonderful series has been long out of print. This was the first Patterson novel to be reprinted and I enjoyed it immensely. But, my opinion of this novel and the series is limited by the fact that so many of them have been translated, many of which are terrible. Most are terrible in some degree. That should be no surprise to any Patterson fan. But, I still find one novel per year worth having.
1	I enjoyed this superb Patterson novel. The author is a wonderful story teller. The story is extremely well crafted and I loved watching the novel adapt into the movie. It was a great experience reading the book and watching the movie. However, the film was horribly bad.
1	This is a fascinating book. I am only recently learning of it. The plot is intriguing and the overall story is fascinating. I read it a month ago and I loved it. This is another one of my favorite Patterson books. This was a great movie, but not great enough for me to have recommended it to the rest of my readers. I guess, if the rest of the world saw a movie like this they would laugh it off.
1	I really enjoyed the book but the movie sucked. Even worse than the novel. I enjoyed the story, the language, the style and the themes of the book. I would even go on to re-read it some more and see if I could spot any new stories. However, the movie and the entire concept really hit the spot just too far. Also, it seems one of the co-stars - the man who plays the protagonist, even in the "bad" movie - was given the role by his co-star in the book. Ahem... bad decision with the stars. So, if you are a Patterson fan, this is not the movie for you. If you are in the mood for something different this is definitely it!
1	I enjoyed this excellent story. The narration by Patricia Patterson was excellent. However, the film was poorly paced. It made no sense and made the movie worse for it! There is no way that someone like me can look at the film and see the same story!
1	I also enjoyed this novel. I only recently stumbled across it. I loved the book. However, the film is an utter disaster. A disaster that must have been made under such high control that the actors were so aware of, that they took one single step out of the room. This was my only complaint about the movie.
1	In retrospect, I really enjoyed this well-written and well-acted film. I thought it was excellent for the kind of movie I would like. The script was good and I thought there were a few strong performances. The acting was good. It was good in a different and very interesting way than a lot of films that I have seen. Overall, it was good.
1	I really enjoyed this novel. It was entertaining and well written with a lot of depth and world building. This is a great book to read if you want a good science fiction thriller or fantasy novel.
1	I enjoyed this novel. I've never liked horror when I've read a book, but it was interesting to read. It was funny, well spoken, intriguing, and the characters were well written, the plot was interesting, and the atmosphere was entertaining. This
2	This movie makes me sick! I cannot imagine such a horrible scene. A really horrible movie made even more horrific by its message. This is truly a very sad and sad movie for me. I hope the director and star can deal with this issue.
1	I believe in God! The story of this movie will take you anywhere you want to go. Every time you watch this movie, you take something away from it.
1	The artistry of this movie was truly incredible, the characters were unique, the story and acting was excellent, and I believe those who have an idea of what it's like to live next to a coal mining town will have a really strange journey coming. It's scary, it's scary, it's scary, but it's also so much more.
1	I must admit, when I first saw this movie I was a bit skeptical about the ending. The story was so much more interesting than I thought! When I saw the first cut, i had doubts, but then i watched all the first seven or so takes and everything changed. I still have doubts, but I'm a bit more prepared now that I have this one. This movie is a master class in what to do with a script. It took me a long time to get my head around what was truly going on, or was going on, but this movie did it.
1	I love to see my favorite actors in a movie like this, and I love to see them be in it. Jake Gyllenhaal in his best film yet.
1	The cast here is terrific, especially the supporting cast. The writing is amazing, and I believe with this piece of art Jake Gyllenhaal would do wonders in any production or television show that needs an actor better than him.
1	The whole movie was filled with emotion, and I believe as someone who suffers from black lung, he does well in this portrayal.
1	Excellent movie overall, great set design, the story is just gripping and the cast and crew were very well done.
1	This movie was an honest look at life and death, and it made for some touching movie. The supporting cast also do well in their part, and I just loved everyone in this movie.
1	This film has a very powerful message to all of us. I have seen this before, but I want to review it again as I think it will resonate with many more. This movie is very well done.
1	I must admit, when I first saw this movie, I was a bit skeptical and thought it was just a cheap piece with a cast of characters who would do anything to get a part. But I must say that it is actually a very powerful and heart wrenching film. The acting was impeccable, and the movie is a truly moving depiction of one human struggle and victory.
1	Jake Gyllenhaal will go places. This is my pick for the best portrayal of a character in film history. Well done.
1	This movie doesn't just deal with what it really means to be human (this movie deals with the struggle to survive in a world that won't just give up, and it deals with life and death), but also looks at life, death, and hope, and how you can bring balance and understanding to it all.
1	All for a great cause. This film gives a message of kindness, love and compassion towards all of us. The movie is beautifully captured and made to be emotional, but is made even stronger by an excellent cast that really brings the characters to life and do some of the best work on the small screen.
2	The plot was predictable for a first movie and boring. The reason I would give it two stars is because of the sequel.
2	Yes they did it. They made a TV movie of this. This movie was so good and so cheesy at the same time. Oh this movie was great! It just made me laugh. It also broke my heart because the people who wanted to see this movie would buy the movie anyway and they would lose money.
1	I guess I have to take this one? I don't know if this show actually had any actual stars, but this movie did. That is why I am so positive about it. It is a cute movie, but it is also so sad.
1	A bunch of friends would go to a movie theater and watch a whole bunch of films and then they'd come back to their seats at the end and scream about the movies that they just watched and that they loved. A lot of the movies were bad and we didn't know anything about it. But we learned a lot because we saw these movies. And now they can tell us what you thought of the movies when you were a kid. It is great just to hear everything through the other person's mouth because they have watched it twice just as much as you have.
1	Now that I have given you all this movie-review goodness, I can finally wrap it up and finally talk about some of the things I love about movies. I love that there are so many different categories of movies. So I can take the ones I like the most and get more into other movies. I also love that movie reviews are a lot like a conversation. You are going to bring up things that you enjoyed or things that you didn't like in the movie as well as things that you didn't care about. So it is basically like a movie-discussion-council or something. This is how I like to watch movies, but this is not how I choose to give my movies the ratings.
1	This movie is just absolutely horrible.
1	I like this movie to hell with this movie.
2	I've never watched a movie with such horrible effects!
1	I only watched this because I liked the TV show about superheroes, Super Friends...and this movie came out a few months after the TV show became popular.
2	This movie is bad. Very bad.
1	I really like this movie the art direction and the direction and the casting are both good, the fight sequences are very bad though, it reminds me really of Fight Club. (It's also in that movie)
1	The music by Robert Louis Stevenson was awesome. The music was so nice during the ending, with the singing the best part of the film. "Waldome in the air". It reminded me of how "Frylock" is very similar to this film.
1	John Wayne is great here. He has a lot of fun. I like the use of the radio to distract us from the action.
1	You've got to love this film. Not only is the acting well and accurately done by the rest of the cast, but the music works very well for a silent film!
1	Well, I liked this. The action was good and the story and visuals were nice. The whole thing was pretty slick and interesting. The story is well done.
1	I loved the main character, and I loved the music, which was very fun.
1	I like the idea of this one, and the action was okay. It was a little slow in action, but otherwise, it was interesting.
1	I liked this. They got a lot of mileage off of the film they were in, so I didn't lose a bit.
1	As someone with a history of depression, this movie was very relatable.
1	Some of it was fun, but much of it didn't have much to give for me. I like the idea behind this one.
1	I liked it. My favorite stuff in this film consisted of the music.
1	The music was kinda annoying, I know, but there was at least a decent amount of it for me. There were also a good number of characters that were quite likable.
1	It had decent chemistry between Fu Manchu and Kelly, but again, I'm not a big fan of this film. Don't buy it.
1	Well, I liked it. I liked the look that the actors were giving to the characters. There were some action sequences, but I thought they were a little boring, and the ending was a little over-the-top at times. However, I really do like the concept behind the film, which is a pretty nice one.
1	It had several good visual things that made it fun to look at. There were some cool touches made on the clothing.
1	I felt bad for the lead character, as he was a bit weak. I felt like the film would have been better had it been about him becoming more of an aggressive person. He seemed like he was just trying to get revenge and wasn't sure how he was going to proceed.
1	I like the look of the film. It was just fun to watch.
1	The music was great in this one. I liked their choice of music over their normal music for the movie. While the story of the film is very similar to the original Bond film, it's not as action-packed, and I liked the more subtle storytelling. The action scenes were actually quite funny. However, I wished the movie would have had more more fun with its music.
1	I guess its a mixed bag. There is a variety of characters that give good roles to all of them. I just did not like the main character very much. His personality is a little generic and forgettable, so many of his actions seemed a bit forced in the film. The story felt a little thin, and the music seemed to play to this sort of thing and wasn't the thing going on that the film was really about. There are some fun effects in this film, but it felt like they weren't used or utilized often enough, even as humorous as it seems. The film is funny, but it just didn't hold to the action of the actual movie; it felt like nothing was happening to make the action fun to look at.
1	I really liked this, but the main story seemed too thin and not
2	The movie opens with an old man (whom we will never see again) begging for a dog that can sniff him out from a distance. This isn't much different to a woman in a bar asking for a glass of water. He is a bit of a dweeb and doesn't exactly look like he could ever carry any weight with him for much longer. Eventually you realise that he is just having his wish granted by a random woman on the street (if that seems too much to bear) but for the rest of the film he is only there to remind you that you have to keep drinking all the drinks because what can help you in the long run of life is a dog with you at all times; and why on earth would you want to keep drinking just for the pleasure of having that dog with you at any moment?
2	A woman (a white female) visits a restaurant in the middle of nowhere, and is served some very sour-tasting, fatty foods. That may or may not be supposed to be about what she gets when she goes to the bar. In any case this is as much a movie about the experience of eating fatty foods as it is about the diet.
2	A newbie to the film industry has just had her first film made, but is still making it for fear of taking a salary. Instead she is made to take the job anyway, and makes her own boss furious with her for not knowing what she is supposed to do. I know that it is easy to write this part off as a story of some bitch getting the boot but the story is much more about the culture of the film industry than it is about this woman being fired... and that is a real shame.
1	Well I know I had to review this one first. I did not think it would be this badly managed and I was so wrong. Yes this movie was great once you knew the basic plot but once you get through the initial introduction I really began to hate every second of it. Yes for the first 2 chapters I did feel this movie could have been improved but not by much as it was all up until the end.
2	I thought this movie was so good it gave me nightmares the very next day. I don't know if I will ever get those memories out of my head. I guess this movie is the opposite of the best movies. It lacks emotion. But then, you can't blame me. No other movie has the same kind of problems.
2	I have an issue with this movie. It is the worst thing I have found to make a family out of. I mean, this is what a family movie is supposed to be, to be for your son when he's not in his "perfect" brain. For some reason all of my son thought this was his family and this movie is the source of everything. The story is very simple, but the movie needs to be more interesting, better constructed and less rushed.
1	This movie isn't about a girl (who I'm 100% sure you don't wanna think about in the movie) from the future, it is about your grandson. But what the movie lacks in detail, it makes up for in sheer strangeness. But it doesn't quite stop there! The character of the girl in this is very different from the one we see in the other movies. She has her own set of problems (one of which being that she's also a heroin addict). The movie shows the first half of the movie to you, which is so incredibly cool you could forget that you actually had to wait a little while to see the second half!
1	This is a very small, but important, film, that could actually have a huge impact on how things are handled for the rest of the franchise to follow. All you will have now are the stories I've outlined above, and the fact that a movie like this could actually make us more conscious of how our media is interpreted. One thing, though, about the movie is that it is about our culture in the early 30's and how that changes over time in terms of social justice issues. This is one of my favorite movies, and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, even if you're a grown up.
1	You've heard me say this in this review. You've got to see this movie.
1	It's a slow and sad coming of age film. It takes a while to realize that this is going on, but it is well done and has a wonderful ending.
1	The story is awesome, the acting is great. The music was great, the plot was awesome, the special effects were awesome, the special effects were awesome, the special effects were awesome. I loved the little bits of humor the scene had (hilarious). Finally, I loved the ending, amazing. You have to watch it.
1	"O Nolo Mio"!!!
2	the plot was really old, the acting was really bad, the special effects were old, the camera angles were too fast, the movie was so generic and too old and boring.
1	this film is very different from the others featured. and there is a good reason for it. it's a film that has it all. the music and the visuals are good. I enjoyed "The Wizard of Oz", it had that old classic magic and weirdness which made it special. "Mama's Family" is definitely different. It has all the classic elements of fairy tales. The acting is good, it gives us the feel of the movie, and shows us that the cast of characters wasn't written as people, but as people who were born into fairy tales (and all the classic characters) and the audience can enjoy them as just that.
2	this movie has all the charm of the "Piggy" or "Fairy Tales" and "Cinderella", and also has all the comedy and the oddness. and it does all of this without being preachy. the other one was preachy too much and I have never liked this series, so I didn't like it that much. I think this should go on the short list of classic fairy tales.
1	this film has a sweet, dreamy beauty to it and a sweet plot and a wonderful cast. the director, who's name is M.G. Kuppie, has created a wonderful film, with an amazing score, and the writing is spot on.
2	the bad thing is that this movie is kind of an over the top one, and it's only okay, if you were looking for something more whimsical, then there are better examples. it has to be seen to be believed, because it's the closest thing I've ever seen to "Pirates of the Caribbean" on its own. The movie itself looks like it's coming from the 80's, but its an 80's film. The main character is a sweet, innocent little girl who believes in the power of dreams, which turns out to be a big lie, when she meets a dangerous wizard. It's a sweet, silly movie and is well-acted and done. it's a very short film, but I like that it has a bit of a different tone, even if it's only one minute. Overall I think this is a great little show.
1	in general this is a fun, magical film, with some nice music by the wonderful Jack Crawford, it's a cute, innocent film, with clever and sweet characters. you should definitely see it for the lovely sound of the soundtrack.
2	this isn't your typical horror film and actually makes me smile. it has some nice humor, it's also a nice fairy tale, so who knows what that will do for you.
1	this movie has more romance, a sweet, childish story, and some wonderful monsters, so don't get confused by the movie's shortness or the overall rating. I say this because the movie is very short. Its about two hours long, so you won't waste that time by watching it to the end. I think this movie will appeal to little ones, as the storyline and the characters are fun. And yes, it's a good movie, just don't miss it.
2	the movie is pretty dark, but doesn't make sense if you know the book. But its a great fairy tale, but not for everyone, so please don't expect a fairy tale of the '80's. And it's more like a 90's fairy tale, so it's no different than 'Piggy' or any of the '80's fairy tales. I think this should make for a good little film, though.
1	the movie is actually a really funny film and has some nice characters. The movie and the cast are also great for what they do, because they don't act out the movie plot. I really enjoyed the movie too, and it's definitely a nice little film. This film should be viewed by people interested in the fairy tales of the '80's.
2	this
2	So funny. So sweet. So adorable. So great. So funny. So cute. So funny. So touching. Really the best Pixar movie ever made.
1	great movie. very, very well executed. great script, great characters and even more awesome story elements... I mean, why is there a movie like this?
2	not so much a movie.
1	A delightful movie. I love the colors, the scenery, the characters! So much character and I think that Disney's animation was just not as complex, so what? It is still enjoyable enough to watch even if you're just watching it to take in an amazing show.
1	A wonderful. I loved this movie. So well executed. Just lovely.
2	so-oo-cute. So very cute. So enjoyable.
1	oh wow, I love this movie! I didn't know how I would enjoy it. The plot is fun, the characters are just so interesting and wonderful, and the movie itself is just so amazing, perfect so far! Just you watch it. ;)
2	not so much a movie.
1	a delightful movie! Great voice, animation, setting, and story. Thank you Disney for making us like this movie.
2	so... so... adorable. Not a bad movie, but not one I would recommend to people.
1	not a terrible movie, just not to watch.
1	One of my favorites. I will always be grateful of the movie.
1	Wonderful movie! Awesome set pieces, animation, characters, and a great plot.
2	not so much a movie, but good enough.
2	What's with all this "The Mummy" crap? I have two films, "The Mummy" and "Tales From the Crypt." They both feature an incredibly strong and well-known bad guy. Both movies are in my collection and I have seen them all for years. What's worse, they both feature the same script. Can't really fault "The Mummy", as it's a great movie. "Tales from the Crypt" is even better. I love how the script for the "Innocent" film (the one where the mummy gets kidnapped) was written while the "Tarzan" script (which includes the entire story of the monkey) was written before the movie was even released.
2	The last Tarzan movie that I've seen. I liked it quite a bit. The first Tarzan film, though much better, also features similar character dynamics- although in an over-emotional, over-tense way. "The Mummy" did a much better job of delivering that emotional punch. It's still as entertaining and fun.
2	The best of the Mummy movies and also one of my favorite of the Tarzan films. I still have this version of the movie in my collection and I still don't have it again. The script/screenplay is much different than the original though, while the movie is very much as good as the last Mummy picture I saw.
2	I always have "Tarzan" in my top ten of the best Tarzan movies and it's still the finest example of the studio's attempt to adapt the classic film. The movie is a must see; it was released in the same year as "Curse of the Jade Scorpion," one of my favorite movies of all time (that I actually own, incidentally). It's a really funny movie.
2	As a Tarzan fan, I find it nearly impossible to believe that this movie was made in 1970. The original, for whatever reason, was taken to be too much of an origin story, and so the studio decided to make a sequel in this mold. It's another well-made film, although I'd give it a little more credit for being shorter-lived than the other movies in the series- it's the shortest in the whole bunch and the reason why they changed the name "Tarzan" in the sequel.
2	I always felt this was an over-produced and under-produced Tarzan movie. I have this one (the original) as well, though some of the other two films were even better. The story doesn't make any goddamn sense. It just makes no sense. I always found the Tarzan sequels to be poorly made movies in general. I'm not saying that this movie is anything special. It's certainly not inferior to this one.
2	If this was just a remake of the 1964 version, that's fine by me. But I have other versions of it. I own all of them currently. I don't plan on ever watching the 1954 version ever again. All this retelling of the film makes the story a bit thin and a bit short. The original is a lot stronger than the 1956 original. "Tales from the Crypt" was better, and that's all I got. I can't remember the last time I seen any Tarzan movie, and I usually don't even watch Tarzan when it releases. Tarzan is a big movie- I really hope I have the time to watch the next two when they hit the video store.
2	If you have a choice of any
1	Okay it should tell you just where the movie is. It's going to keep you in the moment, from one scene to the next, and maybe just a little bit more. Just do yourself a favor, go see it. You won't regret it!!
1	I'm not talking about the "story", I'm talking about the characters. That's what it's all about. And it was so sad to read in this movie, how some of the characters could not bring themselves to say "no", or "no".
2	What I mean by "what in hell ever happened?". Did it happen?! Theres no way to tell, no reason even! I mean no way was there a chance for me to like this movie, or make sure I wouldn't end up in the same situation as the bad guy, or the worst of both worlds. It wasn't worth the wait!! The best thing is that it showed what happens to both of you! I will definitely be returning for the sequel. Also, I love when the characters have fun with it.
1	It wasn't bad. But the ending was awful, so horrible, so unnecessary!!!
1	"Ain't no way that can be happening, can it?", I thought. I got another one, and that one was even better. It shows us the world of the movie itself. It really makes us feel like we're in there.
1	I love it all the way through! Every point of it was so perfect, that I could watch it for hours and forget that it was the first time.
1	It was a nice way to spend an evening. Not the action/chaos at the beginning/the ending, but that the viewer got to know the people better as the story progressed.
1	I love this movie! It did what a good movie should do. It told us an even better story that didn't bother me, but also put an element of excitement back in the story. One more time I go see it!
1	I thought this movie was one that would make you feel bad for the characters, and be unable to understand why they have to do what they do. I wasn't expecting "the end". But that is what happens, and I still find it interesting.
1	And we all must have our own opinions too, and I do think that's important. I am going to have lots of them on this review.
1	Don't worry! It has the characters you deserve. We will be talking about them as we leave the theater. The movie is well worth all the trouble a little bit of time and a lot of effort put into and can bring you a little bit of happiness, along the way. It may take a while, but it's worth it.
2	I was hoping to see some kind of humor, but most everything was too serious. Maybe I'll see this one again at a younger age once I've seen others that are just a bit sillier.
1	If you like horror and the old 80's, then "The Ghost Dog" is definitely THE classic. It's easy to start out watching and just enjoy the eerie images, but once you get into it a little more, you'll love it as well. This film was actually shot on location and has that old old 70's feel to it. This is a really good old film and I'm glad its still being preserved in film.
1	"The Ghost Dog" is a very cool film and a must see if you like dark comedy and creepy film. It stars Bill Murray, as he plays a creepy ghost who tries to scare Mike Myers. There was some humor throughout the horror movies, but it was never overly cliche. It's nice that I was able to appreciate it after I have seen it once. If it wasn't for it's great performances from Mike Myers and Bill Murray's creepy ghost, this would have not been my favorite horror movie. It was just so creepy and creepy that I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore, I wasn't as entertained but I was still thankful for the film. Great film and I highly recommend it.
1	I loved this film. After seeing the original "The Hills Below" I was curious to see this. I thought it was really scary. It was a dark comedy and really enjoyable. The acting was great and so were the music selections. It's a classic and it's still one of my favorite horror films.
1	This movie has some really great old movie music and it's really scary at certain moments. It's great and is definitely worth the watch!
1	One of the most interesting of the old movies. When the original is seen in reverse, this classic is just as scary if not creepier. The acting is great and it is very disturbing for sure.
2	Not enough details given about this movie. Not worth the time it took to watch, but it is still one of my favorite.
2	Not one line was given about this movie. It's probably one of the most watched of the old 80s, not for bad actors, but for the bad writing and characters.
2	One part of the story could have been better. There's a great story hidden away, but the characters come off the edge of the screen. It's almost just a glorified, cartoonish cartoon. It's almost comical. Don't bother watching it. If you're still reading this article, the only person you'll be hearing again are the words "SILENTS" and "STOP".
2	My two favourite film of the year. I love the characters and the film itself is so unique, you'll soon discover it yourself! A perfect example of how an artist can make an un-recognisable work of art, and still make it feel like the genius of its creator. So simple! There's nobody left at the end, but in the end, the protagonist's life just got a bit better. You'll be back for more next year.
1	A great example of why'serious' films are so popular. They are funny, and a lot of fun. The action in this one was pretty unbelievable, so great.
1	Another great example of how a film can be better than it should be. Another great film from Carrey, who also got nominated for an Oscar. Another great example of a film being able to have it both ways. A classic.
1	It sounds silly, but I think this film was actually a little underrated. I love all the characters, but it's not like they are all really likable in this movie. They're all flawed just like us.
2	Another movie that had great music, but not enough to make anything worthwhile. I am so grateful.
2	If you've seen a lot of movies, you might have heard of this guy. He's a guy that made it through two years of school by never watching a single movie or reading a single book. What he did was put a bunch of his friends and fans together in a hotel and film everything he learned at school. It's the movie "Blurred Lines". His performance is legendary, and still is. Good for him!
2	A movie that could have turned a lot of heads, but it took everyone for 10 minutes to see the ending. A mediocre movie that almost lost you in its own darkness. The ending was so ridiculous that the only thing it accomplished was to set up a ridiculous storyline that didn't even seem to have a purpose. Why did this just happen? Was it an accident? Was it a conscious decision to show us that people can be hurt in one way or another? How did the people in this movie get hurt? When I look at a movie like this and think, "What the hell?" I just want to tell them a joke.
2	This movie doesn't have an interesting premise, a really unique story, or some great performances. Instead it's just some people laughing at themselves and trying to make their jokes funny.
1	There is almost no way that anyone who saw this in the theatre today will find any fault in it. I honestly thought it was a remake of a well known movie that someone else made years later. But how can I forget? How can I forget how bad it is at 2-3 hours. <br /><br />Animated movies are my favorites, but this made me laugh my ass off so hard I cried. I hope someone comes out with a completely original story, maybe even in the format of a 3-D animated movie. I don't know if it will work or it's going to be an anime, but if someone could make something amazing this would be hilarious.
1	I watched this once - it was only a few years ago when it was first released - I'll admit that I had NO idea what it was about. It was a very cute little animated movie. I watched this thinking it was a little story about a little dog that had a heart attack and ended up in jail. Well, it turns out he has a heart attack, and also an evil robot that is chasing after him. So, after hearing a voice that was about a big bad wolf, he leaves the place where he was and tries to get back into that jail place. So, he runs down and meets a girl. After a while she tells him that her dad ran away with another girl and he is the one who is searching for her. After saying hello to her dad, he finally finds the place where he runs away. She tells him that her dad was found in one of the bars of the big dark space that is always dark, so he goes into the bar of the big dark space and finds that the girl who is with her dad is really a clone who had been killed by the wolf who is chasing after him. So, now that he's back in the real world, he doesn't tell the girl about his dad's death, and she runs away too. He is then found by the robot. So, he has to fight this guy as the robot and get her back home. At the end you see the girl get out of the giant cell.
1	And of course I loved the end, and especially the ending! The script is very simple as it is, but it does tell the story nicely. Now you all got to see the movie and all that. Now don't stop till you see the original anime and the ending, I promise you will miss hearing that ending, and the rest of this movie, just because it was in that ending.
1	I just went online to see this. I had NO IDEA what a movie that was and how amazing it was. I mean I love anime and all and I watched this a hundred times. But to see how they made a movie... I'm soooo impressed. It looks so great from the picture of the movie, to the animation of the movie, to the voice acting and it was a very nice movie, to watch as a kid and an adult. It's like the story is just about a few characters. It might have been a small movie, but it's so cute and fun to watch for a kid without it being too sad or scary. I always have to love little movies that have characters to love.
1	The movie is good if you don't mind animation. But the animation at times feels a bit too "cartoony". I think the animators would do better to start creating their own
1	i think this is the best movie about bonnie and clyde i have seen. i love how these two seem so happy. this movie is about two loving lovers and how their lives turn upside down so quick. There are some really sweet moments in there and the chemistry between the two is very believable. i give this 4 out of 5. i love the character of the main character, the romance was real and very strong. i recommend this movie for all who like classic movie love stories.
1	what i love about this movie is the little bit of humor and how Bonnie and Clyde seem to have a great childhood. The action is top notch and has great editing. i feel this movie is very heartwarming and i wish there was more of the story. The only two movies that i think have this kind of heart are "the curse of the cat lady" and "the curse of the black cat lady" and they both starred different actresses.
1	this was what i wanted when one day i got the call about bonnie and clyde. it was going to be a short adventure movie like a lot of other kids movies. i remember some of their friends were calling to talk about how they saw it in the theater and what it meant for them. i gave it a try. well, it just is. i liked the idea or idea of this world. the main characters were good, the action was good, and the story of how the world becomes a trap would be good on its own; but it just isn't enough. i will give this movie 4. i think it is ok it is kind of silly but it does its job. i recommend looking for something else to watch if this makes you feel something.
1	well im not a big fan of the "it really happened" kind of movies so this was a big let down. some people may have enjoyed this movie. but in my opinion, it was pointless. i liked how people lived in this world with a great sense of family and love; but with the fact that there were criminals roaming the streets. i would give this movie 4. i liked the main character and i would give this movie a 5. i would even give this movie a point and say that the music was pretty good as well, but this is probably a movie that would only be of value for the people who enjoy that type of content. I would say that i don't think this is a movie for everyone. but if you like the characters and need a kid's adventure movie or a kid's movie with great special effects then get this movie.
1	this was the first movie i saw that i really hated. it was like watching a really bad episode of some kid's show. i had seen so many children's movies where the moms are really mean and selfish and are just out to make the kids feel bad and miserable and i found this one to be not so good at all. the other kids were just really bad and i dont give the kids character arcs because they all have the same big problem where they do stupid and mean things and then just want the approval of the adults. i gave it a 5. I really thought the movie was better but i do like movies with good action and sometimes kids just need a bad time to be sad and lonely.
1	this is a movie that i would recommend anyone to see because they liked the story of clyde and bonnie. it is a bit confusing and the characters are very different so you have to watch this one several times to see exactly who is right in your mind. it was great because all of the kids had a really strong chemistry between them and i really liked that. the movie also has a really good ending that you have to really watch and remember. i
2	There were moments of the story that made me really think that the writers of this movie weren't even that good. I think that it does contain some really funny moments but it had a lot of weak moments in the final third that just put a damper on everything.
2	I have only seen the trailer before the film but there is something very different about it that I would expect from a film that will make the Oscar rounds. There are little nods to a ton of other movies in the movie, even though the story is about that film. There are at least 3 references, all of which are completely unrelated and never explained. There is also a reference to a horror film that I didn't even know I had saw. At one point, the movie had a character who said a word that was similar to John Carpenter's famous "creeper" quote.
1	This was my favorite of the series and it would have been even better if it had a shorter runtime because I couldn't handle the story being so short. The ending was also really cool and it would have been nice to see a more involved interpretation of the ending.
1	The storyline was good at the end and the characters really got over the fact that the world they live in had been ruined by some of their own family members and they finally got to go back. It's really strange to say that it's the first "real" science fiction film I've seen in a long time. It also helped that it had two decent supporting actors in it. It was a pretty solid sci-fi story but I don't always think that it really adds anything more than a pretty basic introduction to the universe of the show.
2	A lot of the stories that the main characters told to each other were pretty weak. Also, the film felt a little flat and boring. There wasn't much that was really new or surprising to be had here, though a lot of other films in the series are.
2	The entire film was basically about their parents and their relationship. It was hard for me to follow the story and it was hard for me to care about this film, which was probably a good thing for it to be a pretty mindless dud.
1	It was fun to watch and it was interesting that the film was so original!
1	Pretty different than the previous one and it does feature the famous horror quote. So if you are looking for a fun sci-fi film that is a little more original, you may want to give it a watch.
1	Very cool, fun, action-packed movie! It was even more action packed as if I had just gotten a new vehicle. The music was also pretty amazing.
1	I really enjoyed this movie, and I actually liked it better after watching it again. There was so little plot, so little action in it, so little heart. But the acting was great, the music was really good...
1	A very interesting movie with an entertaining plot and a well-paced thriller. My friends and I were all very entertained but by the end I realized this is not the movie I was anticipating. 
1	This film isn't going to be for everyone, but I really liked the first 60 seconds of it -- a family reunion where the father (Sam Elliott) comes home from prison and the children (Emile Hirsch, Emma Thompson) find out why he was incarcerated. The ending is not as satisfying as the beginning, but the first 20 minutes are fantastic and the second 15 minutes are outstanding. (I hope they have another spin-off film to add to this movie series.)
1	Beautiful story of an 18-year-old girl with cancer who, in the midst of her illness and the death of her mother, is finally able to have a normal family and go back through adulthood.
1	This was a wonderful story about a family and their new son. The father is a big-hearted but not arrogant guy who wants to give his child the best opportunity he can. He struggles and doesn't always know how to do this, which is probably what makes him the father he must be. All of the actors really brought so much warmth to the character. I also really liked the scene where the father gets an erection when he finds out that he may be the father to the girl of his dreams.
1	This is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. And I'm saying that because I'm not a big "Book, Parts 1-2" type of guy. It is one of the most moving and thought-provoking films I've ever seen, and it's not even an adaptation, it's not a remake, this is it. The best thing about this movie is that all three parts were made in the same time period and for two hours. The movies are set in the '80s, so I'm sure it would shock some people-- but there is humor in there, there's a little romance, there is "The Princess Bride". It is truly a wonderful film.
1	The plot revolves around a cyborg cop called an agent of law (actually a cyborg ninja) that is called into action by some criminals because he hates the government's use of cyber-surveillance. The protagonist, Major Motoko Kusanagi (Hidetaka Miyazaki) is very different from her robotic, mechanical counterpart of the 1960's. This is a very entertaining action flick, filled with excellent action scenes, but this is ultimately not your typical Hollywood spy thriller. The movie is set in Japan, which is why the action scenes are in Japanese rather than English, but the story is full of international intrigue, and the twists are great. The casting of Mami Kawada (Star Trek Star Trek Into Darkness ) is really pretty, and I know I'll mention her in my review.
1	An epic tale featuring a samurai (Geena Davis), a robot (Michael Kelly) and a cyborg. The samurai is very gruff and self-righteous, and his motivation is to kill all of his opponents (except for the cyborg), and the cyborg is a warrior who fights by hacking and hacking until he gets it right. While he may not be super-brutal, he is a badass and that's what makes it so enjoyable. This is a very good movie and I don't really know if it's for everybody, but it's very funny, and this film can be quite difficult to understand in English. (Japanese subtitles are very helpful here to translate into English.)
1	A good story about martial arts and the effects of the brain tumor. A lot of people don't know that the fight scenes in this movie were shot with a digital camera, which creates more cinematic results. They also are much quicker. You could easily spend more than half an hour watching this.
1	A modern classic. This was made and released in 1989 and is one of the most successful comedies ever made. A movie about one man's journey, with a unique concept. It is still one of the best to this day.
1	This is the worst movie of the 1950's because it is so boring. As a movie reviewer, it is my job to be objective as possible, however, a great film like this one, would bring the audience to tears, by showing them that every bad person is an asshole. An excellent movie indeed!!
1	It was an incredible movie in 1966, set in a fictitious 1960's America, centered around an aging, wealthy and famous gangster. I haven't seen it yet, it has since been remade numerous times, but I'm looking forward to it.
1	This was one of the funniest, most exciting movies of all time for its time.
1	This is my favorite comedy of my generation.
1	Wonderful movie!
1	This is one of the best comedies of all time. The plot is based on The King of Comedy (1930). You see the story of a family man, who is murdered. In the ensuing police investigation, he is discovered to be the murderer of his wife and her lover. After being released from prison, he makes a very daring, yet dangerous, escape from prison. The film is truly magnificent.
1	You can't have a perfect film like this unless it is remade many times. One of my favorite films of all time. Highly recommended.
1	One of the weirdest and most memorable films I have ever seen. The story is based on a very well-known joke. A group of actors walk into a movie theater and play a series of games to win a cash prize. As each player wins, it gets more and more bizarre and the audience keeps laughing until the final game. The story is a parody of the Western, where a gangster finds a bounty on him, he kills members of his family, and decides to get revenge by playing the "Western" games. However, his plan goes awry since he is a professional poker player. The story goes on to introduce the famous theme song of Benny Goodman. I loved this and thought it was hysterical and fun at the same time!
1	A good movie to watch when you are bored. Great for family viewing.
1	Another good comedy. This one took the world by storm because it was remade a bunch of times. A funny, dark, and very violent story.
1	One of the best comedies I have ever seen. It is about two very similar gentlemen, both having a lot in common, who are both obsessed with their spouses. They have an amazing story of revenge and how they go through hell when they finally beat their spouses.
1	This was a very nice little movie. A great movie for the entire family. It's an epic epic tale of a man struggling to find a way to save his child who has passed away. The movie is based off an adventure novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson. That means you are dealing with a very twisted, twisted guy, who might be a lot like a lot of other character in The Lord of the Rings movies. The actor is probably a lot of what you are looking for in a bad movie.
1	My personal favorite. It has wonderful originality, great humor, and an amazing story.
1	Fantastic!
2	A fascinating classic.
1	Another great film, but also very different from anything else ever made. It is based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe.
1	The movie can only be described as magical, magical. All the characters are so endearing and likable. It is just an absolutely incredible film.<br /><br />It has fantastic art direction and incredible animation, I do not recall being with any other movie that has had so much talent placed in the hands of a filmmaker.<br /><br /><img /img>
1	I am not sure what this movie does well or what else it could be doing right. That is the fun of all of this movies! I was really amused by the scenes, but it still lost me a little. The acting was great and most of all, it shows that sometimes movies make you happy with what happens instead of just the happy ending.
1	This movie is a good comedy, there were also a few funny moments. The film could be better, but at this point it did a wonderful job of giving a laugh.
1	Great acting, great writing and nice cinematography. All in all a great movie of a great show!
1	The best adaptation of the best show ever. I was excited when this series was aired, but the first season was just a train wreck. This was still a great idea, if not executed well, on the whole. The actors are phenomenal, they use all manner of acting styles and techniques and create some hilarious scenes together. The acting is strong throughout so it's just a matter of finding the comedic moments that work for the character and what they can do. Overall, great! I recommend it to everyone.
2	A bad sequel, but still a classic. The new one is good enough, but it's kind of of out of place. This was a really good series and it was never going to be the same...but it made me laugh so much I didn't care, even though it was completely out of character...
1	I can't imagine a better adaptation than this. All three directors were great and I was very curious to see who they would cast for the lead role. Paul Rudd was just fantastic. He had a lot to learn, because his character was played by the one and only James Wan. Wan is hilarious to sit around with.
1	Amazing acting and writing. I loved the whole series, but this was the best.
1	Very funny, smart, and just fun. I loved all the action scenes, which are very smartly done.
1	Great action scenes (especially the one where they literally fly a plane from Sydney to Hong Kong).
1	Enjoyable movie with good characters and good dialogue but not a lot of action, but it does contain enough to add to the experience. Excellent acting by Semenovic as you would expect from a leading man. <br /><br />
2	This is a very funny and nice piece of work. Very interesting storyline and some good humor. Good storyline, a nice twist, but no action or gore or scary elements.<br /><br />
1	Not too many bad reviews but maybe not all the reviewers have seen the movie. The only bad review, that I have heard, is regarding it being too emotional for youngsters. I think this is understandable, as it's a story about the rise and fall of young Russians. It is very entertaining! <br />
2	This is a very good film. It's very funny and clever and it is very dark, and it's scary. It makes me laugh a lot. My favorite movie in the series
1	An extremely well written and directed comedy. One of the most memorable and memorable movies in Russian history. A very funny and exciting movie. A good movie. The funniest in the series. Score it 9/10. <br /><br />
2	A very good movie!! I think that its main flaw is that, being a very short movie, it doesn't really have much time for the main characters and is more of a stand-alone story. Also, you don't see much of the story at the beginning and it only kicks in after a while, and the final scenes are long and boring, making one think it's over.
1	A superb example of how a good movie can be made with very little money and the proper training of the actors. I'm a huge fan of film noir and love watching great dark comedies done well.<br /><br />
2	Good movie but not quite for me. Not really my cup of tea. Although a good movie it doesn't really make my favorite, and if I have seen it I have to say that it needs another 2 hours to make it my favorite.
1	Very good movie! The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that the final scene is a little too dramatic.
1	A very good movie! But it is one of those rare films where everyone wants to see the story unfold, so I wish the main characters were a little more present in the film. If I'd seen the movie more closely I would have thought that the climax for the main characters was a little too short.
1	A great movie! Definitely a great movie. The ending is great too. Not one that I'd re-watch often as I often have other things to do.
1	Quite good. A lot of fun, but not really my cup of tea as I tend to prefer the more conventional "serious" movies. Also, the ending sucks as it was rushed and lacked a nice final scene.
1	A great movie! I had no idea that I liked this movie so much. I am a huge fan of the Russian drama genre and this movie was a real treat. Lots of interesting characters and lots of laughs. It really went above and beyond the call of duty. If you were thinking of seeing this movie and you had no idea what it was, you really have to check it out. There's no wrong choice. But the same goes for everything else. We need more of that and that's why we will continue to see good Russian dramas.
1	An excellent movie. The storyline is very interesting. A nice story that combines suspense and horror elements. Great acting by all the cast. I think that all three actors did a great job.
1	A great movie. There are some things that I disagree with that I could really see improved on, but then again, this isn't my movie review....
2	That is the most boring movie I have ever watched, and I was just beginning to enjoy this movie. It is so bad, there were times where I thought it would never make it to TV and I couldn't take it. Maybe I was just bored by the story telling. It does, at least, try to set you in the middle of things, if only for a little bit of suspense. But when that's the story, no amount of narration can make it enjoyable.
2	It's called A Perfect Murder, but I'm not quite done with the movie yet. So I'll save you the trouble and just say, "Breadth and Depth, or: "WTF?!?! Why the hell did they even go that route?
1	I feel like if you like action movies (and not just action-heavy films), it is worth getting. There are a couple of action scenes, the story does not deviate one iota, and the acting is ok. The only negative thing I feel is that the script is pretty generic. It may be true for most films, but for movies like this, I don't quite understand it. But it's not like it's not a story. I'm just saying just that the acting is sub average.
1	So what gives with the story telling here? Well, yes, there are some action scenes. No one in this movie does anything very entertaining. As for the rest of the story, let me just say, it is very dull. The whole thing is just a bunch of boring dialogue, almost as if the director was trying to force you to like it. I think I'll just give this one a two star rating, because the action scenes are pretty awesome. The story was not as good as the action scenes, but it was enough to make this one worth watching. You do get some interesting background stuff and the characters are well written. I guess the best compliment I can give the movie is a four star one. But I can't help having to give it a three star for the plot. It may have some ideas, but it is not something that really makes it a whole new movie. So it is a mediocre movie. Like the others in this trilogy, it is not memorable or memorable in the way a memorable movie should be.
1	What a terrible movie. When it started
1	This movie is a good watch and contains a lot of gory scenes. I`ll even get you a discount coupon if you're in a position to do so.
1	Some things here might be considered "silly," but it`s still a good story with a nice plot. I guess that`s all that I`m getting out of this movie.
1	The movie itself is entertaining with a great story and special effects. But some parts of it are too long to understand or enjoy entirely, and I don`t think I liked any part of this movie. Still, this is a good movie.
1	This movie was very well made. However, I hate the acting in this movie. If you like comedy, then this movie was not for you.
1	This movie was very well made. It's funny, and I have a feeling that the main character, Tom Cruise, has some funny moments here and there, but all in all, the movie was extremely uneventful. I will give it 1 star.
1	This movie was very entertaining. It's kind of boring most of the time for me, because of its story, but I definitely enjoyed it.
1	This film has some interesting ideas, so I thought it was definitely worth watching. However, the acting and the story isn't very funny, and the character designs are not pretty (at least, not according to the movies I came across before this one, but I think most of them looked pretty well done). Overall, this movie was pretty lame.
1	This film is a bit cheesy, but it's better than what I saw this movie as. Basically, it was a nice action movie.
1	This is probably the most famous movie of the 90s. I think it`s fairly funny, but it also has some pretty bad acting. One of the best I`ve seen in the whole 90s. Nowadays, it`s actually not really called "Borat," and it is no longer made any longer…
1	I liked "The Lord of the Rings" movie better, and there is no contest here. If you`re a Tolkien fan, then look no further. There is nothing really special about this movie, but because of the name (or rather, because the movie was not really about the history of the Lord of the Rings novels) I find it a bit interesting. Well, it still remains entertaining, but a bit boring.
1	There is a strong story here, but the acting is so bad that you don`t believe your eyes.
1	I wouldn`t recommend this to anyone, but if you like horror movies, then I`m sure it`s worth a watch.
1	I found this movie to be pretty entertaining, but the story is pretty dull. The special effects are quite good, but they are not really anything special, and they seem to be recycled from various films. I guess that`s what everyone says. The real entertainment comes from the special effects here.
1	This is a very good movie. It`s a very good action movie. It`s a lot of fun.
1	This film is somewhat funny and it contains some interesting ideas, but the acting in the movie is bad. I guess I don`t deserve to be rated such a small number, but if you`re a fan of bad acting in movies, then look no further.
1	The story is good, and I like the characters a lot. The best part of the film is a scene where Christopher Walken plays a villain. The film is not bad, but if you were looking to watch bad movies, this is definitely not it. If you think it`s too funny, then I guess I don`t deserve a rating of "0".
1	What a movie. So many characters and so much character development, but the storyline isn't quite good, and the movie does a lot of "special effects." This is a good film of mine
1	The great Australian writer of the Australian Song and dances of the Australian film music (Dancer) is not only one of the leading men in television, he is also a musician! This is another wonderful film. He tells us a lot about Australian characters.
1	The film "The Australian" is based on true events in the Australian town of Ballarat, Victoria in 1901. There were six people who died and another thirty-four injured when the train driver blew up the train, killing a lot of passengers. The film has excellent performances by the actors in the role of the victims and the two real-life survivors. The story is about love, loss, bravery and bravery of the people.
1	The best thing about this film is its production by Australia. There are no other films like this in Australia.
1	The film "The Australian" is based on true events in the Australian town of Ballarat, Victoria in 1901. There were six people who died and another thirty-four injured when the train driver blew up the train, killing a lot of passengers.<br /><br />I never knew such a big incident would happen in the Australian town of Ballarat and the story of the victims is told in such an extraordinary way. What a story. A great story of courage, love, loss, bravery, and courage of the people to take these horrendous risks in order to overcome a bad outcome."<br /><br />It was such a joy to see these people in the film. I could not believe that so many Australians were actually alive in that tragedy. The people of Ballarat deserve so much recognition. I hope we see this movie at festival in the future, so that more Australians know about the tragedy, and will have the courage to rise- up to stand up to those who would do them harm. In a democracy, we need the same courage and love in dealing with the enemies who would do good harm. It's not too late. We have time. Please let them know. This film is so worth hearing.
2	As is usual with a lot of movies by "Hollow Point" it doesn't go the length of the other reviews. The plot goes on and on. I thought this movie was very entertaining and I really liked some of the action sequences. But once you get past the scenes of people fighting, and getting to know the character of the gangster (Shaquille O'Neil a.k.a. the Genie), and the storyline of a genie in a jail cell, it all starts to get boring. For one, the plot never seems to have any legs because you never really know what is going to happen, and who is in the gang of thieves as they decide to go and steal from a factory.
1	This was a good movie that had a good story
2	I still don't like this movie. I liked Tia Carrere as a good looking girl but there were times she looks almost too good for her bad role too often.
2	This was a fun action movie but it was too silly. Also, it was a big hit in theaters, but it may have made it a hit only because it was very successful in a movie theater. A successful movie? Well, you see the negative point.
1	I liked this action movie, and it was about a guy who is in a war against a race of aliens. I also liked the voice actor who sounds old but it all feels natural; I also liked his character.
2	I liked the acting which was by Donald Sutherland who can speak many different languages but who at that age has become quite a professional.
1	This movie is about a robot who travels from planet to planet and fights the "dark lord" in that. The character is played by a very attractive female but I like the fact that the guy is not a villain but really a friend (if he weren't so bad in his later life). So, the movie is about a robot and a girl who travels from planet to planet and fight evil beings. The movie is good
2	I think this was a movie not worth the money. I think what is supposed to be a comedy has become very lame. Also, I never know what any thing is going to be.
1	We had so many movies around that time, so I thought "Why not a bad one and also a funny one", and we had a funny one. The story is about an elderly man who becomes a super-hero and has to go into his house to save his pet cat from the evil henchman. I enjoyed this movie as it is really funny, and good action sequences. But the comedy doesn't really happen in this movie, it just keeps growing over time and turns out like this: I really enjoyed the movie as a comedy but a bad one. Still for the most part it is funny but it just doesn't work for me.
2	The cast is great so the movie is definitely worth a watch
2	I feel that this is one of those movies where an over the top musical number like those in the "X" films would serve more interest than the plot. Also, the musical number that follows after the credits had the funniest line in the film.
2	So, that's it for now! For the last month or so I have just been focusing on the negative reviews. Let me know if you have any of other favorites I could cover. The best is always still ahead...
1	this is a story about friendship and friendship's value. You can watch this film and laugh, cry, cry, be in pain or get a little mad.
1	this is a film to watch with friends. I can say this film is a true gem for your movieshelf.
1	This film about a school has some well done comedy and romance, and I can definitely see what they did with the film with their budget.
2	I am a big proponent of supporting independent artists. But I am not impressed with this film. I cannot imagine how they made a film that does so much damage. I cannot imagine how the director made such a thing and then put out a film with such poor reviews. It is just really uninspired and a waste of your time.
1	This film is my personal favourite of the entire trilogy. This is a film that is touching, funny and beautifully made. But this film also represents something that I feel very strongly about and feel that a lot of people can relate to. ( I am a big proponent of supporting independent artists. )
1	it's the perfect follow-up to "Huck Finn". It's very much the first film to make the jokes while making those jokes. So, how good are those jokes? Yes, some are good, some are great, some are not well written, some are poorly written and others make you laugh by their very nature, but most are made with great talent.
1	it's a great story, it's well paced with great humour and it's a great film to look away from, because it really isn't a drama or drama with comedy.
1	this movie is the best of a franchise that has existed. I had seen one of the movies before, but when I came to see this the second time, the movie came alive for me.
1	It's great... really... just really fun...
2	There's nothing that happens except for the camera panning and the sound making it more comical. If you want to watch a movie that's funny, you have to go for one that's funny.
1	it's a fun movie...
1	It's a funny movie... but it's also funny as hell. People keep saying I should watch it... which I'm going to say... maybe. I have seen "Huck Finn" in theaters twice... once as a kid with my parents... and once years later, the second movie when I was a kid...
1	It's fun... it's a funny film... it's funny.
2	I saw it one time and one time I'm watching it because my friend told me to go see it, and I had forgotten this movie because I went to see a funny movie which was better. Anyway, the movie itself is fun, the story is great... this movie is perfect.
1	it has a lot of good humor about... people, characters... and I liked this movie... I'll watch the movie again but definitely not the second or third times. I'm definitely watching it... just not the second or third time.
1	The funny...
1	I had found this movie when people put on a show, "The Comedian on Monday Night". It is a classic. The actors are all perfect... just like the last movie. The movie is well worth watching...
1	It was entertaining...
2	I loved it. I loved the idea of this movie, it was about a group of people, that just all get so upset with everyone else...this movie gave me a good laugh and definitely the idea of being completely fucked over by this society.
2	Good comedy. If you've seen any of my reviews before, I really recommend not watching this, it is very silly, and not one of the funniest thing I've ever seen.
2	I saw this film and laughed my ass off! I'm always a fan of "mature" movies and I definitely recommend this one for that reason. I think it is kind of a good "watch though" if you're into silly comedy.
2	I had the same experience that the other guys had. I hate it when I see that a first movie with no great cast and crew, like this, ends with a film that has some good laughs. But what I can say is that it may not have been an easy task to find these movies in Mexico. With the movies I try the most I keep my expectations low and I never get disappointed. I could be wrong. But for sure I will have better adventures in the next months and maybe even this blog will tell that I'm totally wrong, and be wrong. I should also know that I have a large family who might enjoy this movie a lot so please keep checking the next entries in this series so you know what I mean!
1	This is a pretty good film, but it isn't what it should have been. It could have used a bit more blood and guts.
1	I liked a lot of the movies in this trilogy, but if this was in my list and I was going to see it, it would be the only one I would make a movie out of. I think, from this title onward, "The Dark Knight Rises" is actually a better movie, and I know that "Pulp Fiction" is, like, more of an anti-hero movie? But what about "The Dark Knight"? I guess that's a more subtle anti-hero, but is that a strong enough rating to make up a movie of 3 hours and a half? I'm not sure how that would go down.
1	I thought these were really strong pieces of TV fare; some actually have some good character study of Batman and Robin, and the overall execution of those pieces is much stronger than this one. I have a lot of opinions on this movie, but my overall opinion is that it sucks. The story is boring as shit and the characters, not to mention the plot and execution, are mediocre.
1	I liked this, but it wasn't that bad that I don't recommend. I thought the plot was interesting, but I was still a bit disappointed with the way the story was executed.
1	I remember the first time I saw this, and I remember the next time I saw it. This is one of those movies that has been around for a long time that is so forgettable the only thing you want to talk about afterwards is how weird it is. I have to put it here, because I honestly thought you knew in terms of "Best in the World" that this was the best. But I guess if you're going to put this there, it had to be here too -- just being there, just walking around like nothing is out there is kinda weird when you're staring down at the ground and still have no idea what it's really about at all.
1	This is an amazing movie, but I don't remember how to rate it. It's a solid movie, just not for me.
1	This film has been on my radar for a long time, but this one I've never watched. I really, really wanted a piece of that "Empire" trilogy, which was not this one. The reason is that I only watched some of "The Bourne Ultimatum," so I thought I would only like it because of that, and also because "The Bourne Supremacy" sucked badly into it, but I was totally wrong about that. So, it was a lot like my "Empire" review, but less than ten minutes longer.
1	I'm always a sucker for an action movie, but I was a big Bucky Fuller fan back when this one was released. I don't know that I ever found another film quite like this one, though that's not necessarily saying much, just saying it was always a favorite of mine. When I say favorite, I mean I think I've said it before, but if I was a movie fanatic, I wouldn't want to watch a movie called "The Godfather" twice, in fact I couldn't see any movie that had a "Godfather" in it ever again--it just doesn't work. Even though they had more than twice the number of films in it, "The Godfather" is pretty much the worst movie ever made about violence. So please, give this a second watch before you get too fired up about its bad qualities.
1	I'm usually not all that fond of bad movies made under the watchful eye of studio heads, so I think "The Dark Knight", when compared to "The Dark Knight Rises," was pretty bad. This is not that big of a deal, as most movies in this series are a bad movie in a series. "The Dark Knight Rises" is definitely in the "good bad" category, because at least "Pulp
1	Amazing movie. A little bit of science fiction but it stays in the realm of pure entertainment. With many jokes and twists, a great film that is really well delivered and one of the best I have seen.
2	This is a movie about a woman's love, a story that has been made into a classic movie and a must-see movie that is extremely well executed and well liked.
1	A good action movie with plenty of thrills, a great atmosphere and a ton of great special effects...and this does all of that within the confines of an hour which is a little bit too short for me! The story is gripping with great action, as well as suspense and mystery, all while keeping you on your toes throughout the whole film. The special effects are also well-done.
1	This one is a movie and not necessarily good. A little bit of a slice of life. The plot is basic but the characters are engaging. It's entertaining, but not necessarily very interesting.
2	This is just a movie that is very entertaining for an 8-15 watching. It's very exciting as it does keep you hooked, but it isn't really unique and interesting in the area. I found myself bored over the entire movie and the ending feels a bit rushed.
1	A movie about an American GI who travels into the jungle to rescue a girl held captive. She is pregnant.
2	A movie about a British-American soldier trying to protect his friends and country.
1	A real classic. It is a story about a young girl and her mother. It is a great love story, one of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Very touching in every scene. The dialogue is also very funny and the art will always be great.
1	A love story, but it isn't a love story. It is a family story, and I don't understand why it was so acclaimed...I guess it was just really great...
2	A very sad looking film.
1	A film that is very interesting. It is a very emotional film. It's interesting to listen to the voice-over. The story is real to the point where you almost feel as if you know the film well. The atmosphere is great and the acting is fantastic. A really nice movie.
1	I love this movie, but not for the reasons you would think. I think that the movie makes you feel sad and unhappy at some points, but when it is a great story that stays true to itself in every aspect, then it is a nice movie. Even though it also has a funny turn.
1	great and unexpected story
1	A well-written, clever and funny story of a father and child, a boy and a girl respectively. Very entertaining.
1	Wonderful story, amazing writing, great music and great special effects. Well done!
1	This is a great movie and well worth seeing. The ending is great!!
1	So, it's good. I'm sure it's entertaining and well-made but what's more, it's funny and a little creepy like so many horror movies do?
1	A good fun movie
1	A few weeks ago I bought a couple of his movies to see if they were good so I didn't have to find them. My kids loved them. They made the kids want to be cool too. Just in case. (We have a good friend who likes to be cool like him.)
2	"It's not what you do to your body, but how you do it." This film is about the death of a young boy who was murdered by his brother for going on a trip with his girlfriend. The brother (playing the detective) is a nice guy and they went on a vacation together, but one day his brother got angry at him and killed him. He then throws his girlfriend's body out of a window to hide his brother's killer. After leaving the house, the brother sets the house on fire, and throws the body into a river, where the boy is found. The murder is ruled a homicide, and the brother is arrested for capital murder. The trial goes on for three years, and the judge calls three witnesses to tell his opinion of the boy. The boy's girlfriend comes to testify and shows how the boy was always kind of a weirdo. It is, for a long time, suspected that the two murders were unrelated, and the brother is convicted. At the sentencing, the family is in tears and the judge tells them, "You gave us life, and now you're gonna give it back." If you have children you will never forgive this movie.
2	Very strong film, well worth seeing. "This is a horror movie about terror, it is not a comedy. I enjoyed it, at first. Then I got to know the characters, the writing had a sort of charm to it. A good story, well told." - John A. Schachter
1	I can't believe it's only one!
1	One of the top horror movies of all time! So good and weird. The acting is very great.
1	THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK EVER EVER!!!! I could not be more thrilled. Not to mention, it's by one of the best horror writers ever. All in all, this is another one of those movies you definitely want to watch.
1	I am a big fan of the supernatural. I have been a fan of movies that feature a supernatural. It's like the thing that brought me to the cinema. So, when I came across this book, I went all out in checking it out. The first impression was... wow. I can't believe that noone made this movie. They must have really been intimidated... so why did they only include two scenes? I can never understand why they did it so differently. That is just my opinion on the matter. But the two scenes that they did include are so well done. The writing. The direction. And the acting. They did a great job directing for this movie. And the editing is wonderful. I just hope they were able to continue to work on it. This is the kind of movie one loves to watch. I'm a big fan of paranormal and all-in-the-same. It seems to me that all the stories need one part and only one... I'm not sure how they pull that off. If any of you out there have an idea on how they did so they can tell me that I can go watch this movie and tell all my friends. I'll go buy it and give it a try. I'm a real sucker for horror and I want more of them. It's always good to have that extra push for me. 
1	This movie deserves to be on the top of that list.... it has so much to love about it. This movie is definitely worth a watch if you can get it on blu ray!
1	This movie is so good.... all the characters are so well written, there is just so much to enjoy about this movie. I feel it got lost in the shuffle with such a lot of other good scary movies around. For me, the story is so well done that it may keep you going longer that you would have probably been. I hope some fans will find this movie too that the same time.
1	This movie is perfect and the cinematographer did a fantastic job of color correcting as well as lighting everything. You cannot go wrong with this movie
1	This film has a really good story and the characters are well portrayed. It has a supernatural angle though. They may have put up some shots that I found not to be the best but at the same time not the worst. I can't recommend this movie enough
1	I loved this movie so much I had to watch it three times. It was so fucking good. The story was great though. I felt like I was in a movie. All of the characters were great and I can really relate to some of them.
1	This movie had me laughing out loud the whole time.. I loved how it took place in Canada. Its always nice to see how they did in the States.. That and its awesome to see how bad it can be.. The ending makes it almost impossible to not cry for the characters..
1	I am a huge horror/thriller fan!! I usually prefer slashers but I just had to watch this.. It has some really awesome action.. The effects are really awesome as well.. Plus the music really set the mood! I love that there is both a kid and an adult in the movie..
1	This movie is such a great horror/thriller and I have to agree the cinematography is as bad as the script is. But it is so awesome! Don't ever give up on this movie and do not put that DVD player down..
1	Okay, this is the true version of the movie. Although it was not as bad as I thought it would be for fear that if I watched this I was going to die, I absolutely loved this film. It takes a real cast of characters, places and situations that the original did not, and uses them in the most wonderful way possible. I absolutely loved the cinematography.
2	Okay, this is also an adaptation. That means that the film is much longer. It takes less than seven minutes to get from my apartment to the theater, compared with a standard 30-minute movie. I saw the movie through and didn't finish it, but if it is the same idea or not, I can't recommend it.
1	Funny and a bit of action, this makes for a funny, suspenseful film. It also, I would think, takes place before the Holocaust really happened, although I can't be certain what date. The acting is excellent, though it's very odd looking at the end of the movie.
1	The cast is great, as they all play their roles well. They all seem fresh. I really enjoyed watching this great movie.
2	Nothing really negative to say. Except for the fact that most of the characters can´t even speak. The English voice is very hard to understand!
1	It's pretty good! It has a little bit of horror, but in a decent way. The movie is pretty well made too.
1	This film was actually a dark film, with a very grim ending. That´s pretty bad, as this is an action movie. But the ending was very well done!
1	<br /><br />The whole movie is really good. I recommend, to watch this, if you are a fan of slasher movies. The movie is a good action film with a good good atmosphere. The story takes a pretty long time but all the characters will get their chance to kill their own self and some of them will do it without help.
2	i enjoyed my time with this film,but i wanted way more and i know the reason,it was a bit too much of self indulging for my taste,i never could get behind the idea of having a man fall in love & having his dreams realized too much<br /><br />3/10
1	why does it exist in america? maybe a film has a good idea and tries to use it well, it doesnt and it dies on the vine. the characters are more than a generic caricature of a human being,they are flawed! how can anyone be so cruel to them? the chemistry between starry eyed and romantic,in the ending and in the beginning is too good to fail and the storyline makes for a riveting and engaging & hilarious watch<br /><br />3/10
1	it's a funny movie i can relate to the characters & their inner lives,but in the end it fell flat on its face,it wasn't enough on their journey towards their goal and that's all it can say. it's just a silly film to the point of being ridiculous in a silly genre,never going to be one of my favorite films<br /><br />4/10
2	i've been saying all along that this would be one of my three true love films, but i can't agree with you,i'm just not going to find a love story to enjoy this <br /><br />1/10
1	this film is funny when it works but doesn't always work well and it goes to far in making you like the character in the end to the point where you don't care if a guy falls in love with the person his sister thought she lost at 4 years old,it just seemed like they went for the most stupid and self indulgent way they could,and it felt like they had a bad idea but couldnt decide whether to add it to further the show or to kill off their main character who was like the only character who really seemed to fall for the person<br /><br />4/10
1	i dont know whats the reason for my hate for this movie...it's funny,that it gets you to feel for someone who will always tell you he doesnt like you,but then turn around and do the same to you in the end,and at the start of the film i kinda liked that the love is from within a different person and in a different situation,i dont think what happens to him is right,but at the end,it's hard to say what it means at all,if someone has love for someone else they have a duty to do they are going in the wrong direction,it leaves you wondering if this is all there is to it,but it goes way past that and it makes one think about the importance of friends and family and how often we neglect them not caring what happens to "us".i guess,it's a movie you cant go wrong with...that's why i like it,it's not going to hit your emotional ceiling<br /><br />3/10
1	this is a good story,i enjoyed seeing who the character and himself were,and yes they took some liberties with plot at times (they needed to),but it made for a well told story,a little like being in someone's shoes,or trying to figure out if your best friend is your best friend or your best friend your best friend!<br /><br />2/10 for a good movie but not a masterpiece
2	i think it's a pity for this film for the fact that it comes at a very time in america where we have all just seen this terrible movie (i'm talking about poltergeist 1& 2) and we can't say much of it about them,so we can only say "not everything is about to die in america...so let's not judge! it just didn't do it for us" but i'm sure it may have done it for you too as it's the only time you ever see yourself in other peoples eyes,not a stranger in fact it was you you just didn't know it could happen that much.<br /><
1	A film that makes you laugh even while you are mad. I love this movie.
1	The kind of film I wanna make when I grow up.
1	This is a film that makes you laugh even when you are mad.
1	I'd put this on the list, but then I would know what an idiot I am when it comes to the film critics.
1	It's a film that is the kind of film that the parents will watch with their kids.
1	It's a film that makes you laugh even when you are mad.
1	This film has two great parts that can be enjoyed independently, or together with family and friends as they all watch together. The first part that really makes the film memorable. The second part that makes the film fun to watch with family and friends.
1	A film that is the kind of film that parents will watch with their kids.
1	Some of the worst people at movies will love this film.
1	A film that does not need much to get people to laugh.
1	A film that is the kind of film that everyone will enjoy.
1	I think the name for this film is ridiculous, but the film is also ridiculous. A film that doesn't need much to get people to laugh in it.
1	The kind of movie that you laugh even when you are really pissed off.
1	This is a beautiful movie that is always enjoyable to watch. A film that is not really that bad, but not very good either.
1	This film is not a bad movie, but you won't enjoy it.
1	The kind of film that kids will watch together with their parents.
1	A film that you can watch anytime with your parents.
1	A film that is not that bad, but not totally awesome either.
1	I think a bad movie deserves to be on the list and this one fits the description of one. It is an enjoyable movie to watch, but not up to the caliber of a good movie because it has so many parts that are not as great as the beginning and the end.
1	This is a great film that I'd be willing to recommend if you have a nice movie theater.
1	This is a very entertaining movie and I really loved the style on display.
1	I think this film is the kind of film that has a bit of darkness about it.
1	This is a great movie that has lots of great parts. The story is good and the characters fit well in its universe. There are also some good acting in the film.
1	A film that is a bit sad at first, but turns into something that is really entertaining. Not an average movie that will make you laugh constantly though.
1	This is an okay movie that has the perfect balance of comedy and drama. I liked the art style and scene with the couple at breakfast.

1	It is a good film with good acting, decent acting, decent movie, decent plot, and good music. It has lots of comedy, drama, and fun parts.
1	It is a good film with good acting, decent acting, decent movie, decent plot, and good music. It has lots of comedy, drama, and fun parts.
1	It's a sad story about a young man who goes back home to his old home to visit his brother, while his brother runs away from home.
1	It's a long train ride. The action is brutal and brutal. If you don't have any experience with that, it may not be your cup of tea. It reminds me of a really good movie called Red Dawn(2012) with the same story, action, soundtracks, bad dialogs etc., though much slower, and more complex and realistic. And we've mentioned a lot of movies with "doll", which most of us will probably have heard, so I won't list one here.
1	It's some kind of psychological horror. I would compare it with American Psycho(1992), you get the "horror" from the perspective of the main character. A pretty good, if not bad movie.
1	A new movie from Bong Joon-ho. A psychological thriller with a pretty scary villain, and some great scenes in the beginning and end with a scary climax. It may be better than your average horror movie though. It also features a great, silent performance by the lead actress.
1	The main character's father is killed by a stranger. My reaction: I think the acting is great, and the whole movie is really good. There's nothing really wrong in it. But that's because I had no other choice but to see it.
1	One of the best vampire movies you'll see this year, one of the best vampire movies you'll see in the last 20 years. It's a vampire movie, but it's also a vampire film from a post modern feminist point of view and it's very good. You'll be moved by the story, the performances, and the characters.
1	This movie is really short and has not a single scene that lasts a minute or 2. It is a drama, but also has some interesting acting and the pacing is perfect
1	It's a pretty good piece of animation, a bit slow and not very well animated. It's a dark and mysterious story. Some scenes of it's kind aren't really dramatic. A lot of scenes have something like "too bad that is" and some scenes seem silly. Also it has a very poor animation.
1	This one has a very long title and some characters that is rather boring. I don't understand what's all that about. This one is a thriller.
1	This is a thriller, but not really one I will watch frequently, not for the scares but mostly for the atmosphere. It has a really cool opening scene. If I don't finish it by the end I'll make a full review.
1	It's a sci-fi movie of a very different kind, a real good movie. A story of the war against aliens in different parts of the universe. In the beginning, the story is very funny, but then you get into serious stuff. Also it's a movie made from Chinese, so I can see why it has some special quality. The story is well developed, the characters are smart, and the animation is pretty great.
1	It's a story of a doctor who wants to cure a man who was in a coma for two years, but the doctors he works with don't believe in him. This is a good sci-fi movie, but it's not as good as Blade Runner with its special qualities, or Alien (1979) with its wonderful special effects. I can praise the special effects, but not the script.
1	The main character of this
2	The final cut is like my brain got overloaded and now it refuses to function.
2	There is a lot of clumsiness and ridiculousness in here that makes even less sense.
2	A movie like this would have looked great on tape at the time of completion, and I still marvel at a 90s sequel with its bizarre ideas and creative way of telling a story.<br /><br /> I guess the last 20% is a testament to the studio's dedication, and hopefully this is the end of that whole ordeal.
1	This movie took me back to my childhood. One of my favorite films! I like that it features characters who get along with each other and have common interests. It's the perfect setup for a romantic drama! The music was so unique and fun.
1	The movie begins with a magic device which takes the form of a huge, giant and black stone. From there, a magic tree called the Tree of Life is introduced. The Tree is inhabited by all types of animals who, in turn, feel a great affinity for the Tree of Life. If a human being chooses to go too far away from the Tree, they are doomed to die by the mysterious power in the trees. If a human falls in love with another human being, a beautiful creature called a Treegirl can be born. If there are enough trees, a great deal of trees will be born and trees. I felt that the Treegirl did not fully have her own voice but that was not really necessary. In the beginning, the movie uses the Tree to show some pictures. Not the main part of the movie (the main characters) but in the beginning some important things about the Tree are revealed. However, the more we see them, the more it becomes more and more apparent that the Tree is a part of the main narrative.
1	I feel that this movie has a great deal of potential and could actually be an exciting adventure movie. I was able to finish the movie in a very fast pace. My only gripe is that I would have liked to have seen more development of the characters. The stories were fairly well written but we never really got to truly know them. The story was well plotted and acted well, but there were no surprises in the plot, which could have made it much more enjoyable.
1	The main character has the ability to read an image and get a very good visual of what the movie is about. The movies is an extremely slow and deep story. You feel that you're actually going through it and that you are going with the characters and the story.
2	I still haven't listened to the soundtrack and I like its arrangement quite a lot. I haven't seen this movie in HD (the movie is in 8:7 widescreen), and it's really hard to tell what it's like in that picture. But what
2	My sister loved this movie so much she made a special video where I played it. It turned out she watched the same segment just for me. I guess it was her last day of work after work anyway. This is probably the funniest film I've seen about the World Trade Center attacks, the only one where I can actually remember anything from that awful day and when talking about it to my friends they are almost to forget what happened in the first place.
2	As it turns out, I really like this movie. It didn't get too crazy right away but I found that by the end I got a good laugh at it. But after each scene they would change a bit. I guess they wanted the movie to be funny, but the director, a former writer, seems to be more interested in trying to be funny because there's lots of scenes where he says something very funny but not even when he's telling jokes or even when he's doing the dialogue or he has a completely straight-up funny joke (such as when his character is driving a car). I was disappointed when he started writing jokes instead of acting like that is what the story is trying to be. Also, I was disappointed at the number of films in this film group that seemed to be about the same thing (The Best Years of Our Lives, An Evening With the Queen of England, A Star is Born). It was very hard to pick 1 in the bunch apart from one character's story and I can see why the movies have been so easy to compare. I didn't like any of them. Overall this is a collection of really good action, comedy, and adventure movies. I can see the movie getting a rating higher than 7, at least in the UK.
2	I am going to say the following about this one. The story of the story was the same as the best of the movies or like the latest Star Wars - a movie about a man who's been in the same boat as everyone else for years. The director's interest was mainly in the action, not so much in the story. I think the director was trying to sell the film as the story of a man who's just being told he's a failure but doesn't want to do anything else to change that, that's all he wanted to do while he was alive, the whole life he is living his life is an escape in a way because he's just lost. The idea that you can be a man in a man-on-a-mission of a day-and-night-and-a-a-day-and-a-night story and be fulfilled as a man from time-to-time and that there are a lot-of-times to forget about, is very interesting and I think a viewer can find something worth playing at this point of the movie. At the same time I don't think it was a good movie as far as getting the audiences hooked. I don't think there was anything else to play to, but the movie kept getting more and more boring in the middle. 1 out of 10.
1	I have to admit I am really glad I didn't miss this movie. I usually watch that most
1	Another film I couldn't help but find interesting is this one. It combines psychological suspense and action in the same film, though there is only one character. There is also a lot of humor in the movie, and there is a lot of violence in the film although not enough to make it all uncomfortable. However, it is not too hard to enjoy, especially if you get some good laughs from it. Overall, I think this movie works well as an all round experience.
2	Another interesting one. It would be better off as a comedy, though. Perhaps a more "family" type movie perhaps, but... you don't see me saying that. You see me saying that. I can accept the "family" nature of this one, but for my taste, it has lost it's charm (in my opinion). That can be seen in the script, also, and as they say, "there are far too many things to complain about here."
2	I am a huge fan of I Am Legend. In fact, this is probably the first film that made me realize an animated film could have a story. This is a good example. I liked the film, at least as a story, and I still do, so I figured if their goal was to do something, they need to stick to what works. And, if they didn't get the script from someone, I certainly had no problem with their not using a script from someone else. If they did, I probably wouldn't have liked it. But, there just wasn't something I could identify with here. The story itself was okay, but this "family style" feel is just too much, especially after seeing a lot of films that try to give the same feeling (usually "movies with a plot"). I'd say the film is okay, but nothing special.
2	This movie is a good example. From an outsider's perspective, the film was alright, but still not something unique. A decent movie on the surface, but it wasn't my top 5. I thought so-so.
2	I have seen far too many other movies with a more "family like" approach to it. However, this one came just to confuse me. First, the art and acting were wonderful, especially for a children's comic. The story was also interesting, but the humor felt out of proportion compared to previous films. What I really don't like about the film. The second, and this is perhaps my favorite problem with the film is the dialogue. It seems that the children don't seem to understand the message anymore. The second problem makes sense, as each character (except for the "old boy") seems to say the same thing over and over. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the concept of a "double sense of humor". So, the story gets more twisted and more silly the further you watch it.
2	in a twisted twist, a woman is abducted and made to be a plaything to a bizarre man who then decides to teach her all the knowledge he knows about making love by the side of a busy city road... The plot sounds a little convoluted but it is actually based on true life experiences. "I was a young virgin, living in the back of my friend's car when my father opened the door and took me into the bedroom. It was a surreal experience. I immediately found the wayward way to distraction, and we kissed. He was so good at taking me out. We made love for several hours that night." rejuvinated lust
1	good film. 
1	this movie is amazing..the author did an amazing job with portraying this movie. The humor can also be found in just the characters. The dialogue is very smooth and you wont regret spending a few hours with this movie.<br /><br />
1	a superb film!
1	i really wanna say this is by far my favorite movie in my books. this movie has nothing to be ashamed of. The writing is so cool and the characters are always funny. The movie has so many things to talk about. this is an experience that will change your life. I love my time with this one.
1	It's what the title says in the name : a perfect movie for Halloween. And I really don't care it's good to see an old movie once in a while! <br /><br />
1	awesome movie
2	I have never seen it and have just thought it is not real.
2	That movie was kind of a turn-off, too. It's funny, but it was a little too "funny" for me and I think it might be too long for kids. Anyway, if you like Lebowski, or movies starring Lebowski, then this is your film.
1	If you had one, it was "The Sopranos" with John Belushi.
1	I'm hoping that some of these reviews will help me decide what kind of film to watch next. It is hard to find a good TV movie lately.
2	It's easy to find great comedy on TV today and even much more difficult to find great movies. Hopefully this will help some of us get what we need to see great comedy again.
2	I'm not sure why I'm writing this on the negative, but why don't you go see this movie so I don't have to write this one.
1	After five mediocre movies, we finally get a decent movie which will do the most for the viewers enjoyment at the cinema. It will certainly have it's share of controversy so keep that in mind.
1	The final part has made the movie more entertaining than most of the preceding parts have had to offer.
1	This is a masterpiece that has surpassed all expectations.
1	Very nice film. This was one of the first films I ever saw where Lars Von Trier was not a child prodigy but instead a very normal boy, with a lot of heart who loves children. My only concern was that the film had to last the entire duration, but it also left me wanting more.
1	My favourite of the five that I reviewed.
1	a simple story for the whole family and it is very well told, this is my favorite movie of Richard Dryfus' career, thanks to him. I found it very inspirational, and one of the best.
2	The best thing of this movie is that no one can say it is bad.
1	The first time I watched it I was quite surprised. It was the most personal movie I have seen. The ending was so special. It was a dreamy picture, and I loved it. It was so exciting, but also so sad. I would love to know why I liked it so much, and how many people liked it with me. If I had just read reviews I would think it was a very good movie. I can only think about it now, it was just a lot of fun for me.
1	It's a simple story, if they could have made it a family movie with one big family, and I would have loved it. You can't beat this movie.
2	It should have been a little more of a horror. There's nothing scary about the story.
1	The director makes a very sweet and emotional movie, with a strong emotional journey, from the characters to the end.
1	A quiet classic, without much tension, but full of heart.
2	A good comedy, so cute at least.
1	Richard Dryfus' movies do not get much good reviews. People think because they were made in the 70s, that no one can be funny ever anymore, and no one should listen to his advice. It is true for the ones who are not funny or not intelligent enough to hear someone telling their thoughts, and not people who are funny, but smart enough to listen. But, I think that one of Dryfus' main goals was to tell the story to as many people as possible. To tell them, "we hear you", and not to be afraid. He didn't come to make me laugh, or to inspire me to be happy or to be a sad person. He helped me to know that the world is full of pain, and to see the good in it and the bad in it and if we see things with the proper wisdom, they will make us better people. He also showed us that we are all very valuable, and that we all have the same purpose in the way we live. It was a quiet, quiet movie that took me by surprise, and was very touching, but it also said a lot about our world. After all, it's better to think about the future than the past.
1	It's a slow story, and a heartwarming story, so that the characters become like children of the movie, and the film becomes a fairy tale.
1	It's a long slow ride that will make you fall asleep and laugh throughout the entire ride. Richard Dryfus was great in the end...
2	I really enjoyed the ending, but it felt very forced. It felt as if they had to change it from an ending that was supposed to be sweet and touching to an ending that wasn't enough pleasant experience without showing the tears. The story may not have had enough emotional impact to make a movie as good as this one. That makes it the last.
1	I just had to start this movie at the beginning, because it wasn't a very good movie for me. It is a beautiful, very quiet movie that is very calm, but has an emotional path that goes down and down and down. Richard Dryfus was good.
2	It was a very emotional movie for me, but I didn't like it. The ending felt so forced as if they were afraid to leave it without an emotional ending. It made me want to cry, but it was very unnecessary to make a movie that takes an emotional journey down an emotional path, one that leaves the audience crying instead of feeling.
1	And they call him Mr Potato Head.
1	The movie starts with the protagonist seeing something very cute coming to the window and he goes to investigate. He finds a little old man eating some lady... and he must save her (again)...
1	Another one with a simple plot and some weird plot twists to it. This one is bad... It is even worse than the others and even worse the second and most recent one...
1	This one is just the most pathetic movie that I have seen so far. The woman had two names. It turns out that the old woman had one and the new one was a girl because she named herself "Bam"... She is always watching people like she is getting paid to watch.
1	This one has already been mentioned in many reviews as the worst of all time. It was the first movie out which was filmed using Technocrane and I can´t imagine the hell that went into its production. The movie itself is a mess... The only part that made sense did by turning it into a horror-movie... What the fuck!!!?
1	This one has to be one of the ugliest movies ever produced for the cinema...
1	Another one with a horrible script and some very basic camera work... The story is pretty boring... The visuals are just bad. This is one of the three that are more terrible than before. That´s about it.
1	The worst movie ever made and not even the worst movie I have seen, this one has been written by the guy who wrote the worst movie ever made called "It". I don´t even know how to explain why the story is worse than that one.
1	A film made by a guy with a pretty boring film. I guess he wants to see what the public thinks...
1	I cannot even think of a good reason as to why people are so shocked to see this on a video store shelf... One can say it´s a horror movie... But, as it turns out, it is almost completely bad and the reason is a man who doesn´t do much in-movie other than eat the woman´s pussy...
1	The plot is a joke. All the other versions don´t even have a plot. The only idea is to make someone a part of one of the two tribes and then eat him (you will see there that this man is not consumed at all and he actually likes it).
1	The plot is good but the rest of the movie is just a waste of production time. The people that made this film probably were just trying to get someone to eat something and they made it work. And it made them a fortune...
1	And this is it... The final movie review that I will post on here. I will try to sum up the things I have seen here so far: 1: The plot is pretty simple. The character that eats the human being is a cannibalist (which means he eats the people in his group) or a murderer (which means he kills the people in his group). 2: Everything about this movie has been made with the camera acting off the characters. So the pictures and the characters are just a backdrop... 3: There is never a real climax. So the story never ends and the plot never does anything. 4: The main characters are all named "Terrace"... That´s the name of the man that is eating people... 5: The only action in the movie is this slow moving sequence that happens... And again it really doesn´t make much sense because the story seems so very far in the future...
1	The last movie I watched was another movie with no good movie (the first movies of this series have always been very good for teens) but this time I am convinced it isn't the last one because it will be a new favorite. This one got me a little more excited about seeing more of these great teen comedy movies. The two other films have their own, but this one got me really excited about more movies again.
1	A great one. I thought it wasn't a new favorite, but that is true because all the others is the same. Then I remembered my dad is always telling me about how funny they are. So I watched it because my dad really likes this kind of movies and I do too. This one is a bit longer than the last two, and it has better movie. I guess my father would be more than pleased to see it again. The only problem is he doesn't like this kind of movies.
1	This one isn't new favorite, and that does not mean it is bad. Not at all. The reason I watched it is because I was bored one day by a bit of a movie and that was it. So I did not want to start a new movie. So I went into my favorite show I love, and it brought me another pleasure and that was when there was a car accident. I could always watch it again and I did. This movie is all fun and is enjoyable.
1	This was a very good movie. It had very funny movie parts and this time, I was not bored by any scene to be honest.
1	This was a good looking movie. I couldn't help it. This was a very good movie and if you do not like, then watch only the movie where the movie is a good looking movie.
1	I enjoyed this and I don't know exactly why. I think my only reason for liking this movie was it was the first movie I remember watching that was not a comedy movie with Michael Jackson. I have no way of finding out why, but I do know it was because it was a great movie. I am totally going to continue watching it.
1	I'm a real fan of this one. It has a lot of good music but also some scenes that made me laugh. I loved the movie. I didn't expect it to have such a cool scene where the girls are hanging out. I think I liked it a lot but didn't enjoy it all the way. But I love the movie!
1	This one was really funny but the story is not really interesting. But not too bad. Just a little bit funny.
2	Another movie that I enjoyed but I did not like it as much as the previous one. It gets boring very quickly once the movie starts.
2	It has a little bit more funny scenes and I enjoyed it. The only issue I have is that the sex scenes and even the movie are not in good quality.
1	The ending is quite nice considering that most movies I have watched so far have started with a good ending. I had the same thought about movies the other day. That you only get one ending or the other one was too good. It is funny though, because I could not imagine watching that ending if the two endings were really so good and not too bad. If only I could get what I can watch.
1	The ending of this was quite nice and not boring to watch. The movie is still good and I like it. The first part did not take me into a good feeling but I liked the second part better and it had funny scenes. I am still enjoying it.
1	I like
1	Oh man, I really enjoy this movie! It's a laugh all the way! Highly loved the movie!
1	A very funny movie, especially the story line! Very nice
1	I think this is a very good movie. But...I'm really not happy with our movie quality. It is very weak. I think the film should be edited to be better done. I think the story is good but the film needs some editing on the story. Too bad it's not available for purchase.
1	This is a movie that can also go back to the dark side of the past without losing its magic! It's very funny!
1	This is a simple, but amusing movie that has a lot of humour, and is very much entertaining. Very easy to follow, and gives quite a good idea of life. You can enjoy all the humor that it has to offer.
1	This is a movie that is about love. It's about a young woman and her new housekeeper, in which she has no real chance of being able to get married. All that changes when her young husband goes on a road trip. Is it really a movie about love? Yeah, absolutely!
1	I like how this movie is so good. There's something cute about it. It's really funny and the voiceover is really funny. The film is not a typical romance movie (although I do like these types of movies), it's not about an ideal couple (though they may be like this). If I had to sum it up to you, it would be "a simple story about two people whose lives in relationship change in the most unbelievable manner." It all turns into something we would never expect. 
1	I got the movie in the DVD special edition. The story really is pretty straight to the point and I enjoyed it a lot. It's really good. The acting is really nice and well done. I think if I lived in this land I would buy this book. The book is about a man who's father dies in a crash while the man's mother is killed. Both are found dead in a cemetery. There are two very young people in the home, who are very close to each other. 
1	An amazing movie that even an outsider could easily appreciate. (that's one reason why it's one of the best films in the world. )
1	A wonderful movie about a man who has the power to manipulate others.
1	One of the best films I've ever seen. It's really funny and very well done. The whole movie is a joke. I was still laughing when I watched it again.
1	It's not the best film with all those negative reviews it has, but it was the greatest film I've ever seen. (I believe it was even the best movie ever made during it's lifetime) (that's my opinion)
1	<br /><br />You will love this movie. It is hilarious and dark. In the story, you are a man who decides to follow a prostitute who seems to possess the power of giving him eternal life. At some point in time, this prostitute has the nerve to threaten our character. When she tries to kill him, his wife, his father, and his brother. That's where it all gets dark.<br /><br />Great. Great. That's one movie I can't get enough of.
1	<br /><br />The plot is interesting even though it seems very obvious. I loved how it is the relationship that has a lot of back-story on both sides. However, in order not to be tedious, the movie can be interrupted when the audience wants to be in a different point of view. And that's what I like about the movie.
1	This movie is a bit of a mystery, and it may be the first instance I've ever seen with a true "Cute" type of character as they try to protect their friends from bad guys. It's so weird and out of the ordinary it makes a viewer feel uneasy when he tries to stop it, it doesn't stop at the first bad guy, the next bad guy is a kid, and soon it's a cop!<br /><br />
1	I love anything with the word "Sketchy", and this is one of my favorite movies. The movie is very clever at times, but at the same time it's incredibly unoriginal and predictable. It has some of the worst grammar in the history of words. <br /><br />
1	The movie is about this guy who lives with his parents and his little sister, and has no friends. He's a huge nerd and is the "best guy ever" and everyone in his class is kind of stupid and he tries to make friends, and eventually some of them start to like him, and he has his own little club that he starts to play in. He is incredibly insecure and self-conscious about this new world he lives in, and there's some really bad grammar in this movie that is not too nice, but it has a very interesting twist, and there's a point at which he really does get good friends. He's very "Sketchy" at times, very un-nurturing, and he is very weird. He is not the "Sketchy " character at all, nor does he think of himself as so. But he's not just the same dumb stereotype, he's a Sketchy character that tries to protect himself from the world as best he can. It's really a great movie, and I highly recommend watching it. <br />
1	I like this movie a lot! It's a really funny and funny watching movie about a man who is bullied by his friends because he's like a bad friend, I can't really rate this movie. It was so funny and weird, it probably shouldn't have been allowed to be rated as it was rated very low, and the only reason that I could honestly think was that the movie was "bad" was because the creators had put too many characters in one movie as it was not done well to make the movie interesting. It was an odd movie. But it was really funny. It was really funny. The cast was really good and the humor was really good and so was the music and the voice acting. And just a lot of funny and funny thinking on the part of the creator of a great movie and on the part of a group of fans in the audience. It was great, I actually laughed out loud quite a lot at some of the jokes. I think the movie didn't get enough credit compared to the other ones on here.
1	Another movie like this, in its own funny way. It's very un-funny, I give it two stars. <br /><br />
1	This movie is not a funny movie at all, it's literally a bunch of dumb actors in fake low hair who think they're funny. They're not smart or funny, they're just dumb.
1	I hate this movie! I actually think this movie is the worst of the three movies in the bunch. I was going to give this three stars, because I think there's a hidden genius in this movie that might have been lost during the editing process. The story is too silly and unfunny for me to even care about this movie. The actors are too stupid, the soundtrack is too short and bad, and the humor is mostly terrible. It's
2	I was expecting better. However, it's very interesting to see how movies adapt the stories to fit the film format. This is a great example of an adaptation that succeeds in giving the audience what they want. It's the complete opposite of the movie that was released a year before. If you're looking for a movie experience, this movie is probably going to disappoint you.
1	Love this movie. The story has a lot of depth, humor and romance. It's quite entertaining to watch and there is some drama in the story. The actors were incredible. The movie does what it sets out to do. The music and the soundtrack are the best part. This movie is well thought out. You can't get a better movie experience than this for kids. This movie made me sad because I saw it and I thought, this movie is really not for kids. However, it's good for older kids as well.
1	A very fun movie to watch with my family. There are some humorous moments involving the characters and some drama in the story. The movie is not for kids though. I thought the ending was rather predictable but it worked for me.
1	I'm glad that I saw this movie. The movie has a lot of heart in it. It teaches a lesson that one might have learned from the previous story. The end of the movie is not too long and not too bad.
1	If you're looking for a unique concept, try this one! My daughter and I were going through some school work at the same time. She mentioned that she wanted to be a dancer so I told her I didn't have the time. I wanted her to be happy so I suggested reading a book that she likes. I recommended that she read The Secret Garden by Judy Blume. The book was a great addition for my kid. The story was exciting and I enjoyed it immensely but I could feel that the end credits were not very satisfying as there had not been anything interesting to happen.
2	This movie was very short on a story or insight in the story. The characters are flat and the movie failed to provide any character growth. It felt like this movie was just meant to be funny. The movie has no real learning of what this story is about. There could have been more to it rather than a quick joke for the audience.
1	At first, I thought this movie was a bit dull but after I had finished watching it, I felt that the movie had good insight and the movie seemed to have some depth at times. And once I finished watching the movie, I really liked it. The ending was good enough to make for a great movie for my family.
2	I was hoping that this movie would be something different. I think I was actually expecting a darker movie with some good drama. The movie seems to have the same story structure as the other movies I have seen thus far. That said, the ending felt out of place and did not go as expected. This was the second movie I watched with my kids. The first movie was a bit too light for my 7 year old. This time, I thought that this movie may have been too dark?
1	I have always felt that kids should really be exposed to this kind of concept. I have heard stories about this going all the way back to the Bible in Matthew 18:1-9: "Then all of you, when you hear that the Son of man has been crucified, and that Jesus died for our sins, how did you know?...So then, even if you are children, live as adults as far as you can!"
1	I had also heard stories about the book and how good it is. I was expecting something different and I thought the ending was a bit unrealistic.
2	This movie has an ending, which happens in the end credits, and my first experience of watching the movie was overjoyed. After the ending, I thought, this will be this movie. It starts out to be a movie about how disability exists, but it progresses to how it's treated, how society takes advantage of it and how it goes wrong completely. But my only wish with this movie is that the ending is cut short and we can see Forrest now in his wheelchair!
1	I can never wait till this comes out. It's going to be one of those rare stand-up specials that will not disappoint.
1	It's just a few minutes long and you could be on your way to seeing a good movie/special all the way up until the last minute. In most cases it really is as cheap as the time is going to last you with the commercials and a really good show.
1	I thought it was very funny. It wasn't one of my favorites, but there was more than one comedy I could enjoy.
1	I found myself wanting to watch it, when its not available online...so glad it is now.
1	I am surprised that there is so few stand up specials on this site as there is with comedy. I have a few favorites, but this one caught me by surprise.....
1	I liked the concept of a movie, I liked the actor, but I did not like the delivery of the jokes. I wish I could give this more than five stars.
1	One of my favorite stand up specials.
1	I don't know where to start.... It took me a few moments to figure this out and I got a laugh out of it all.... I thought it was a big deal that Dave would stop the movie, only to re-start it.... (well, the funny part was that Dave made an excuse to start it over again... And for me...) If you get a chance to see Dave on the first of May at the Improv, I would recommend you definitely do so -
1	You get a decent laugh here and there, but I still cannot decide if it's really an improv...or not - but it is one of those classics that will stick out for a while.
1	Wonderful performance by Eddie & the script and camera work.
1	Love this one, one of my favorites of all time. (not sure about that last comment..... I read it before I finished watching... and I was like wtf lol)
1	The funniest one I have seen so far!!
1	This one of the best improv specials I've seen. It is one of the funniest ones I have ever seen (and if you know stand up comedy it is hard to think that, I just like the kind of comedy that is always funny)
1	This is certainly one of the more funny specials. I found it to be funny and well done.
1	My rating is a 6/10. The movie seems to want me to like it. It does not work. This is a movie about a guy that gets his butt kicked by a girl. It does not work and I do not want it to. I dislike how the movie was cut up and turned into movies. A 4 out of 10 at best.
1	This movie has the potential to be amazing, but the problems make it hard for me to recommend (especially for the weak part of the story I mentioned earlier). I do have to praise the story, but if only one scene was changed, then the movie could be wonderful. So even if the story is great, the movie should have been better. I only have four stars because the movie is not good enough. It could be very good, but is way over the top. 3 out of 10.
1	 Terrifying. It's a horror movie, and yet it's scary as hell. The movie starts with a mother having her child die. The father of the child takes over and doesn't want to give him a funeral. Then they watch an old video made by one of the grandparents that was on another machine and they learn that he murdered the child with a blow to the head. In a way, this makes his child's death and revenge very much justified. So if you are someone who likes horror movies, this movie should be watched!
1	 Greater Than A Man is about a guy who wants to see the world. He's an artist, a writer. His brother is a cop and they are both interested in his art, but his brother is more interested in his job. The movie is about him and why his brother left his job. And the movie has a good ending. The movie has a story about a man who is still living in the same house and his sister says that her brother has been very quiet ever since they went back to Africa to see their grandmother. To make them believe that they were in Africa, his brother took his wife's house and got rid of everything. There are two endings. One of them is very sad so I would only recommend it to someone who wants to have a good ending. The other ending is much more serious so I would not recommend it to anyone unless is something is going through the mind of the person watching it. That's why I rated the ending 3 out of 10. I'm not sure if you were told that there are two endings or not. So if you are still reading it, please try to not judge the two endings. I did find the ending a bit sad. 3/10.
1	not very good in my opinion. It was very good in it's own time, but we are past that and we get a bunch of mediocre stories with lots of action to make them entertaining.
1	this movie was not as interesting to me as it should have been. It seems like they were trying to make some good science/tech movie, but instead I think they gave us a very bad story that makes me want to skip it. I do like the plot, but it felt very lazy and unfinished. All the characters were boring and had terrible dialogue. The movie has a strong visual design, but was boring to see. Most characters had bad chemistry and it was painful to watch them try really hard to look cooler and more attractive.
1	like many of them, this one was actually really good to me. I was bored almost every moment and thought the plot really lost it's focus and moved in a way that was just too slow and too simple. There was very little action and lots of exposition and character development was rather bland.
1	this movie did not impress me much, it felt pretty samey. It had a good old-fashioned western setup with all the heroes being young, pretty and cool, and had it's fair share of action. It was very predictable and was just another movie with a lot of good, but not enough bad, action. I can't see where the story was taking them. It has it's good moments, but in the end it just didn't add up.
1	the plot was rather confusing for me. I have seen the movie a couple of times (for good reasons, to get more of the details of various plot points) but I can't quite figure out what happened. I think it was some kind of secret mission to a certain planet and it was decided that the humans were the evil ones, and that a new group of evil aliens would be sent to the planet to destroy them. The plot was not very interesting, and it did not follow the usual pattern. I think it was just to try and make it seem a little more epic. The characters were all flat and made me want to move on to the next movie. It was like waiting for someone who will show up.
1	like many other bad sequels, this one had been released before, but for some reason this one was even worse than all the others. I think it was one big money-grab, where the studio wanted to make a big, big sequel with lots of money attached, but decided to do it all with cheap money, cheap actors, and cheap special effects, while at the same time adding a new evil alien called the "Demon" of this universe. The story was not nearly as good as the movies that followed, but this one still had enough character drama and drama to not be boring.
1	I didn't think the plot was at all compelling. The whole movie had only ONE plot twist that was so bad...
2	this movie was just another bad movie with no plot twist, horrible characters, bad acting, and cheesy bad special effects.
2	it was really hard to watch...
1	this is the best movie of the 20th century, the best movie of all time. Its quality is so high that it can be considered as one of the classics and the greatest movies of all time. This movie can be seen as a masterpiece and no doubt has many more of its fans that haven't read this blog, but I am just a fan of the art form of cinema. The only disappointment I see here is that it looks like it might
2	First movie I got to see. Everything was a lot of fun and lots of action. But all the action was only in 1,4K. Even the special effects in the background are very disappointing, because this was supposed to be a feature film.
2	Nice, but the story was done poorly and the acting and acting of various characters was not that good. The scene with the naked woman was just a bit too much so, it became very vulgar. And they used a really nasty scene between Stanley and Iris at the end that was bad.
1	This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, it's one of those movies that really should have stayed in the DVD box because it did not deserve to be in the theatres. I will never see this film again, and that'll be my fate. The plot is like a dumb person attempting to think of something better than the current situation at hand. I saw this in the theatre, it was terrible. 1/10
1	Another one of those movie that is a perfect storm of poor scripting, lousy direction and poor acting, made all the worse that this story's main subject, an ex-con, is actually a fairly successful person. A plot that could have been done better does not end up being done, with this film just turning into a bunch of bad ideas tossed randomly into a maelstrom of bad action and uninspired characters. So yeah, it's a bad movie. 1/10
1	A movie just to remind you that I will never watch that show again. It contains some pretty amazing, and funny scenes and a surprising amount of heart-swelling emotion, even though all the action is set up with such a level of absurdity as to be almost comical. Sadly, the ending is so disappointing and weak that it hurts the film to the core. I feel so bad for all the people that had hoped that it would be a little bit better, but the result was simply so terrible that it left me in tears throughout the entire movie. So you might as well just skip it completely. What a boring and bad movie. The only reason why it gets a 4/10 is because it has some genuinely good moments, but I can't say the same without giving some credit. 4/10
1	An elderly professor at New York University, with a large number of young and old male students who share his interest in science, comes to campus in search of inspiration for the next generation of brilliant scientific minds. This gets an A+ from me, but it had me really intrigued. Not only could this one-off film make for a unique and original story, you would be amazed by how well the script was handled, from its great writing, to its well-written characters, to its incredibly well-constructed plot, to the incredibly well-acted performances. The film itself works perfectly well as it is, and it even manages to bring in some great, and cute, visual moments. The script is one of the most original I have ever seen in my life, and it just gets worse and worse. That's right, it gets worse and worse as the film goes along, but this is the last we are going to discuss about the film. This film is a flop. 2/10
1	A movie about love, loyalty, and the end of the world. This film manages to bring me so many incredible emotions, through its amazing writing and the acting from the two leading men and their respective supporting cast. The plot itself is almost perfect, with some of the characters actually making sense, and it actually manages to be an interesting and gripping tale while I was watching The Day the Earth Stood Still. It was just such a perfect movie, that I cannot say enough how amazing it was. It will forever be remembered as one of the most beautifully written and acted films and comedies I have watched, even if I do have to cut down my score a little to do so. The plot itself will always be remembered as the best, but it was also one of the most touching and emotional films of all time, it's one of those "I can't believe it, it's perfect" kind of films I can only imagine. 2/10
1	It's a very good horror movie, one of those that are just so well made that they really work well. I love the acting and music all the same, to make it work, it needs to have a unique atmosphere to it; things need to be done as well to be
2	I really like this movie!
1	Great! Amazing movie! It's nice to see the world the way it is, but not everyone is on the same page, and that's why a movie should be made to make everyone, each with their own unique perspective on a subject and their own opinion. So as this one is such an easy one to understand for the non-experimental, that's exactly what I was looking for. A good balanced (and sometimes weird and hard to understand) movie for those of you who want to make your views of the world a little more personal and personal. I really liked this and would recommend it. The main question for me was whether or not I would still like it as an adult. When I actually watched it, the answer was a resounding 'yes'.
1	great movie, it's a good one to see what your average person thinks and how others react.
2	good movie, great special effects too.
1	I love the movie!
2	the story starts good, but then he keeps going to a wrong place. It was good.
1	this is a cool movie.
2	that kind of movie for us kids.
1	The Special effect was great!
2	This is one of those movies that will be remembered for a long time yet, for the art it's being portrayed with -- a story with such compelling and beautiful characters. The acting is great and the music is fantastic. This film is both tragic and hilarious. What an excellent film!
2	It's hard to argue against the excellence of this film, simply because the quality at least is that high. Very different from any other film of this era...with one important difference: The director has decided to shoot for a day or two at one specific spot (an abandoned hotel!) to get an extra perspective of how the city looked before any construction.
2	This is an entertaining and very moving movie with beautiful cinematography. The lead is an extraordinary young woman named Dora Langella. I'll make this a short review since there is so much more to be said about this amazing film than I've been able to fit in here.
2	One of the best, the first American film produced by the independent company of the same name. With a unique cast (Mia Farrow is an incredible actress and she has a great way of displaying her emotions), it's a great time-travel movie. As is true with all the many movies which I've watched from the United States in the past few years, the cinematography and score are great. The soundtrack will be forever associated with The Sound of Music.
2	In his first feature documentary film, a man has a long and harrowing story about an abusive childhood. The story of his childhood, and how the abuses of love and relationships lead to him forming his first movie. Great movie.
2	For those of you who don't speak German and need a guide, I'd recommend you watch this film. It's an interesting, moving, touching story with a lot of emotional depth.
2	I remember the first time I ever saw this film, it was very moving and in very good taste. If you like the classic music-filled, musical theater-type films made before the 1970s, you will like this film.
2	The story of this film is one of the very few that will bring tears and memories directly to your eyes.
2	This is one of those films that will be remembered in a very long time. A real gem!
1	i'm very excited to see this movie because i think this writer can be one of the greatest in the world (not one of my top 3 writers on the net) and this movie is just like that....
1	i think that this movie will go down as one of the best french movies in the world...
2	A bit short compared to The Black Cauldron, but it is still a well written and enjoyable movie. But the movie is too fast paced to relax. it could use another 3-6 minutes with it's story.
1	Excellent movie that brings more depth and character to an already well known classic. Definitely worth seeing, even if a little slow paced.
2	Really fun movie with a good story, the movie is not a short movie. The action will get you hyped like a sugar rush, just remember that this movie has a lot going on at the same time. you can expect an incredible story when the movie does finish.
1	Another well watched movie that is quite engaging with very well done characters, a solid story and cool, action packed special effects. An awesome movie worth seeing.
2	A well-constructed film, but perhaps not exactly a classic in every respect. If anyone reading this has seen this before, then know they're mistaken. It's a lot of fun, though. I'm not sure I can recommend it as a modern day classic. 
1	The film focuses on a young boy, played by Richard Wilson Taylor, who lives with his grandparents. He has been living a seemingly happy life in a secluded area of the nation, but an event occurs that threatens everything.
2	I feel this film is one of the worst examples of rehashing of a well-known classic, but it still is quite enjoyable. There is no doubt it is one of the best known modern day adaptations of a well loved novel.
1	A fine film with some very well written performances. It is worth a watch.
2	I hate to say this, and I wish to avoid the subject, but this movie made more money in ticket sales than any of the other two I just mentioned, so there is no reason to give it less than a perfect five star rating.
2	But that doesn't mean it isn't a gripping movie! I have to admit, that I was surprised at how much I really liked this movie. I thought it was going to be a good comedy. It is not your typical rom-com or a romantic comedy. It has suspense and it has a very strong female lead. It was unexpected, I guess I was expecting a story set in the 80s.
1	The story is really well told. You really get a feel in the movie that David is not an ordinary film maker. He has something special in his character. I really enjoyed this movie. I was also entertained by the film's music.
1	Great acting, outstanding set pieces. It was a very stylish film. There were a lot of twists and turns, that we had to wait for the whole movie for us to figure out. The music was absolutely awesome! I enjoyed every minute of it! The acting is top notch. David has been able to bring out so many of the things in his character. He is a very convincing and believable character. David is a really nice man (in that movie sense.)
1	Well...this movie is actually in 3 parts. The middle one is quite good but I'm only happy that it had a strong female lead. The second one was way better but I had to wait till the final one to see that. And that last part, which was the most enjoyable of the three, was also a little difficult to understand and watch, even knowing very well those things, I thought it was just ok. It was all just too slow. I think once the viewer understands that it was much more interesting than the first half. I have to say that the first half made a very enjoyable experience for me, with the middle being just a little bit better. I think you could call it a 3-star movie. I could also see I could probably give the third one a 4-star score as well. But I think you can just give all four of them a 5-star rating and be satisfied.
1	Another great movie to watch this summer. The cast is amazing. David, Ramesh and Kriti are some of the most talented actors I have ever seen in a movie. The set-ups are interesting, the action scenes are absolutely crazy, and the romance is the perfect combination of romance and romance. Everything is done very well, there isn't one negative thing in the movie, and David is just so cool!
1	This is another one of the rare Indian films that gets away with being a rom-com because of the relationship between the main characters. David gets a lot of the love scenes of the movie but there were quite a few times when he had to do some serious acting. The plot is very well told and David has a pretty cool voice/voice actor. It's clear that the writers are really trying to portray the feeling of the other characters. This one is just so well-crafted, and the characters and the plot are well-developed. It's also well worth a watch, but it might take a little longer to understand all the plot elements. If you are like me, you might not be able to get through the two parts of the movie.
2	I still remember how upset this movie made me. I think it was the biggest mistake that David did while putting this movie on screen. I know, it was a very well-written, but the story wasn't even remotely believable. As an aside, the plot structure of this movie is completely off from that of any other romantic comedy; the second half is a lot more difficult to understand, and you have to watch the second half in order to enjoy it. The first half was so much better and it was one of the most enjoyable movies on my year
1	An ordinary person with a lot of power in a world of great potential, and he just so happens to find himself in a magical world filled with monsters and unicorns. Now is that a movie? I don't want to know--it just reminds me of the time we watched the original movie.
1	Pretty weak production values are not at all why this film is so low on the list. I still think it's about as good as you're likely to find of the best of the late '40s-early '50s monster films.
1	The movie's over-the-top theme of the "Power of Nature" is too cute and silly to be taken seriously as a film, and this might be one of the worst films of its era.
1	A short film that is more entertaining than just about anything else on record. It's also a good movie--this one is a lot more exciting than the average of the best American monster movies.
1	It's not about what it seems at first--it's like an interdimensional intergalactic voyage.
1	Another monster movie with such low production values. Its theme and action might be fun, but not really worth the trouble.
1	Is a good comedy and a bit of a mess but not quite a cult classic.
1	The world of The Little Engine That Could, the best monster movie and story ever created, is one of the great, enduring stories of the late '40s-early '50s. It includes a beautiful, moving story about a small, simple man (played by the late John Wayne) and his desire to save the world, and three very good monsters that all bring something to the movie. It's definitely up there with the best of all time, most of which was made much more cheaply in the '60s. So, it's an OK movie, but it is certainly not anywhere near as good as most of the best horror films of the era.
1	It has a lot of good ideas, and the screenplay is great, but just barely beats out its better-known brothers, The Wolf Man and The Monster Squad.
1	The story is quite good. It's really good at it, as is the production and the performances, but there are just a few problems that make it fall short of the best horror films of the period. There's an awful lot of really bad acting to this, both by some of the cast and by the main antagonist, who is, for the most part, a pretty despicable individual. There are also a couple of really dumb things on TV in the later part of the film.
1	The whole picture is pretty great, though the direction by George Sluizer is a bit much.
1	Good. Great fun is made here. Though, the character development is more than a little thin.
1	This is a fairly well-made movie, if a bit shallow in spots. I'm not sure why you'd want to spend a lot of money on something like that.
1	The plot might not seem worth following, as there isn't a lot of depth, but it definitely has character dynamics and some good laughs. And it's in an enjoyable period with great production values.
1	Okay, so...
1	There's not much of a narrative, but the monsters are pretty strong.
1	A pretty mediocre movie--very few of the story's themes are conveyed well or directly, so none of the performances are very strong. There's also a decent amount of "monster of the week" material, which is pretty entertaining.
1	Okay, this is the kind of thing you do better with friends, but it is a lot of fun. With few exceptions, the performances are pretty good--and the writing may or may not be.
1	A fairly decent movie, even if the special effects aren't very good.
1	What a lot of kids get wrong about cartoons! It's a decent little adventure with a lot of fun little bits. It'll appeal to a good number of different ages, and the overall
1	This was a decent thriller (with some intriguing space-alien/shower scene stuff that I may watch in the future) I guess you could say the story wasn't bad. The story took me out of the movie quite a bit that I'm not sure I'd feel very satisfied in watching. (*2/3)
1	I was so frustrated not being able to view this movie I just decided to watch the VHS on Youtube instead of watching it. (**2/3: The movie is still available online for free)
1	The only way I could think of to describe this movie was just to compare it to a lot of other films I've seen that have a similar concept; i.e. A sci-fi thriller/action movie with some action and sci-fi technology mixed in. The acting was actually pretty good, with most of the actors I have seen in movies coming off as very believable (if a bit overdramatised). The script was not good. I don't think I've seen the movie as many times as I wanted, and probably only watched it once, and that was because the people who were complaining to me didn't bother to read the synopsis, so they just gave an opinion. Even then, the movie was not very well done. I mean, you have an amazing (and fun) chase scene, then the movie just ends with a huge explosion and nothing happens. It was just one large, lazy action scene. Overall, not a bad movie either, just kind of forgettable/bad.
1	The whole movie felt pretty generic. I thought the special effects looked pretty cool in certain scenes, but then I'd hear some random noise, and think "Oh, I think that's another one of the special effects..." And that'd be it. The movie needed way more of these. *3/4: I actually loved the movie pretty well. The story and the acting was decent, and the special effects were a blast to watch. You could see some really promising future movies of this style being done down the line, but those movies will be far and few between. This is more of a "look around, see if you can spot a better/more promising tech movie" type movie.
2	Not exactly a bad movie, I like the plot and the acting and the special effects were pretty cool for a while, but by the end everything just got kinda predictable for the most part, and I started getting frustrated that the special effects were barely needed to keep everything alive and the rest of the movie felt like too many scenes that were nothing more than filler. So, let's talk about the special effects. This is a movie that was made to bring us something new and unique, and they just failed miserably at that.
1	I love the movie. I love the characters, I love the special effects, and I love the acting. The only thing it really failed at was creating suspense, just a bit. But it still was worth a watch. As far as the actual storyline goes... "The story opens with the crew of an alien space ship, being captured by a group of strange-looking humans. One of
1	I've seen it a few times with various groups. I was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely not a blockbuster like I would have expected. It's entertaining enough to give you a little enjoyment.
1	I've been to this a couple of times and I am loving it. It's a very whimsical movie and I love the use of color. The characters are all so fun! I don't see how anyone could possibly hate it!
1	I've seen this one or two and really enjoyed everything about it. I didn't think this was so much of a science fiction flick as I thought it was more of a love story involving animals in a far off place. I think the movie could still win big time over an average movie.
1	I know it's pretty hard to come across a movie that doesn't have lots of stars, and I can say with a good faith that this is one of those movies that is hard to find, but I wanted to at least share it with someone. I thought it was nice and funny. There were some nice creatures too (a dog, a lion)and I loved the little bits about the time the movie was made, so there was more to it than meets the eye.
1	This movie is in the top 10 for the best movie of its type I have ever seen. The reason why I included it at the top of that list is because it is funny. This movie isn't easy to watch, but with the right people this will make you laugh your nuts off!
1	Another one I heard of and read about online. It makes you think and that's good. You'll be wanting to start over if you watched it, but even the next time is a lot more enjoyable. One of the cool things about this movie is that it tells the story of what happen to the last man on earth after he died, and it all depends on the weather of the day. It makes you want to know more and is good for your brain.
1	I've not seen this one, but I loved it when it first came out, so I was looking forward to it as a review. What happened to the animals is not explained, and I'm not exactly sure why they are not coming out to get their dinner. In that case, why would they come out here? I've never liked when animals are killed for entertainment. I guess they're not the intended audience. This might be a good time to mention that I do not like to watch movies where people eat each other though. But the fact that no-one's eating is a funny story.
1	This is an excellent movie, with lots of good effects. At the beginning of the movie we are shown a picture as a background, which then is given a face. Then we're taught that it is us, and we are in a desert, and all the animals are here, so naturally they want to get some lunch. It sounds wonderful, and the characters that we watch are wonderful. A very good movie!
1	This movie is fun to watch! I've seen it in different forms, and I loved it. The animals in it are great. If you're a fan of movies that have no animals in them, this is a really good movie to watch.
1	If you like animals, be it in movies or in any kind of creative medium, this is a fun one. Many times you get to see animals who are not as well-trained. I like this movie for the fact that it makes you think and it makes you wonder.
1	This movie has everything you could want from a movie. There is so much to love about this one! The animals, the humor, the acting and directing. I loved it!
1	I liked this because I really thought that it was funny
1	This movie made me realize that it's not what you get in a film so many feel is the pinnacle of movies and it's the movies that should win over me. It's not a film on the scale of a King Kong, it's not going to be seen at the Oscars. This is a movie on the scale of an award winning film that's going to leave me satisfied that I saw a good movie for a little less money. If you've not seen the movie before, you are going to go at the story and the characters with passion. It's really a really good film that is a reminder that you can't take anything for granted. It made me appreciate movies even more.
1	I like the idea that the plot makes you feel when you see it. It's something the average viewer wouldn't know and that's what I like.
1	 This movie made me realize how lucky I am to have made a career out of making great movies.
1	This movie will get you excited. I love a great movie that reminds you that you can make them your own.
1	The story may be predictable, but when you watch this movie, you'll laugh. This movie is a great comedy and fun. The ending makes it a fun film.
1	I love this movie. To call it an enjoyable movie is an understatement. It plays to your emotions and wants. It is an emotional movie. It takes you on a journey.
1	A fantastic movie with plenty of heart. When you watch this movie, you feel like you truly came to life. I like why all those people were in the same place. The character development was good and the character deaths were funny.
1	This movie was great. There were a few interesting characters and a fantastic story. It just works if you sit back and enjoy.
1	It is a wonderful movie but it's not for everyone. I didn't have a problem with the ending because I enjoyed the whole story and the characters.
1	A movie that I felt that I could see myself in and I liked the character development and the movie. A movie that I don't regret seeing.
1	In many ways this is the perfect example of what a story should be. A story where characters are able to overcome the obstacles thrown at them and come out the other side. I can't wait to get to watch more.
1	I really like this movie. It's interesting to see a man who lives in a different time, a man who doesn't recognize himself, a man who is trying to make it. A man who tries to figure out who he is through all of that. A man who believes that when he makes something, people will like it a lot more. A man who refuses to accept that life is going to be hard. A man who is a person who tries, even though he doesn't believe in it, not to be afraid. A man who doesn't let anything make him feel bad about himself. The movie made me laugh, believe in people, and was a great movie. It just makes you laugh again and again.
1	Not for everyone. Maybe that's what makes these films so interesting. They are meant to be enjoyed in a slightly different way than most. I feel that this movie is an excellent example of this. I can't even figure out why these guys can't make something up.
2	I was hoping that this movie was going to fall apart. It really just falls apart. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy that it turned out differently from our expectations.
1	The first of many movies I'm expecting to be very good from this director. Unfortunately the director took a huge leap into the past which isn't very good. The acting is good but I don't know how to rate it without spoilers. If you like the kind of movie I thought was cool to me in the 90's then you should go ahead and rent this movie. If you grew up with a more mature story like movies like the Dances With Wolves movies, then this will be a great purchase.
1	The film is definitely one of the more unique movies I've seen in a very long time. It's kind of an odd blend of something and something else. It's not quite an original film but I'd have to say it's my favorite of the summer. If you were a teenager then you were probably hoping for a summer film with some action but it never even came close to what was to come. If you haven't seen "Lucy", I would encourage you to look into picking this one up.
1	This movie has a lot to recommend it and it's worth seeing. It's not really a movie by any means but it has this "big twist" ending, which I enjoyed but didn't love. It is the most well-written movie I've ever had the misfortune to see and maybe even the most successful of all the summer movies. The acting is pretty good and the way they have managed to show off all of this is really, really, really well done. 
1	There's a lot of heart and emotion in the movie "Lucy" and I think that was really good. I'm not a big movie fan but what I would really like to see is if a director made another "Lucy" movie that had an action element to it, without going into too many of the "Lucy" storylines. For instance a sequel/sequel/remake/remake/remake and some kind of "Lucy"-themed film just like "Dancing With Wolves" or one of the "Avengers" movies are the only way I see a director like this continuing his work. I'd like to see a director like this that really takes risks and brings a fresh new twist to the horror genre. I'm hoping that this new direction will help create some more successful horror movies like the "Dances With Wolves" movies.
2	First of all, I think that I enjoyed this movie, but the story is just not that good and I think that the character of the bad guy are the worst out of all the bad guys. The only good thing in this movie was the dialogues.
2	I thought the plot was good for once. The movie is more about the world of the bad guys, with the bad guy making bad decisions to get back at bad people for their bad actions.
2	This is a solid film, except for the horrible movie script.
2	Like I said, the story is good but the characters are the worst villains you would get see. A really bad movie!
2	The story could have been really interesting, but it really was very dull. If you really like thrillers a lot, you probably won't enjoy this at all
1	Why would anyone have made this kind of movie in the first place? Also... why is a person who is being stalked in a hotel a villain? (I'm going to call the guy "the creep" because he looked like an evil character from some 90s slasher movie.)
2	Who let the director of this film, John Carpenter, direct a movie that has nothing to do with the theme of this post? <br /><br />A real mess.<br /><br />Trying to make something that looks like something would have sufficed for this one, which is unfortunate because the movie itself isn't even about stalkers and the creep is a creepy fucktard.
1	There's not much to say about this movie other than it is really bad. All in all, this movie doesn't impress.
2	It's the kind of movie you see at a party when people want to talk about their favorite TV shows. Don't even be alarmed by the title. It's called "The Fart Show," and it's really a fart show. As such, it is only funny if you are actually watching the show! It is also an unmitigated waste of time.
1	I've never seen anything like it, and I am the kind of person who finds it absolutely hilarious. This film is essentially the plot of this film! It stars an American, a British, and an Italian, and each of them has the same dreams to become an astronaut. It's a very good film that you should not miss.
1	This is the ultimate Italian comedy! The script is so good, even the dialogue sounds funny! The music is brilliant, and the people (including two of the two lead players, the Italian and the American) really make this a fantastic movie. Seriously, they are awesome, and I had a great time writing this review.
1	A pretty funny movie, and a great character study. The idea of having a mother that makes love to her son with the penis isn't really that funny, but it's fun to watch. When Dolph was playing her, I honestly didn't like her to much at all.
1	It's funny, but it's like really old-fashioned (and not really old-fashioned). What a cool movie. The only thing I don't like about it is the ending. I think it would have been better if there was a cliffhanger.
2	It's a great movie, and a pretty good character study. The ending is pretty lame, but I guess that's what a cliff hanger's for. It doesn't help that the ending is a terrible and crappy joke (to put it in layman's terms) of a joke from the movie "Tron." It's not meant to be funny, but it is funny, and a great character study. It's also the first film of its kind to take place during the time of George Lucas' Star Wars, so I really think it's a really interesting concept. The best part about it? It's a movie about the idea of Star Wars, and it's awesome.
2	a pretty good movie, a character study, and some really hilarious jokes. The story is really funny, and the script is terrific, and it's also great to see the Star Wars stuff again, but I also think it could have been better. The ending is a little annoying. It feels like they were trying to shoehorn this movie into the timeframe of Star Wars' production. That didn't work at all, just make up some goofy Star Wars references that aren't going to annoy any of your regulars.
1	Pretty good! I actually enjoyed the ending a lot. Like a lot of things in this movie, it really depends on you because it's not like this is the first movie to ever make fun of Star Wars. They had some serious issues with the characters in the movie, and this movie really did show a side of the guys that we haven't seen before.
1	The one star review I actually did give in the end. The bad writing and some of the acting is the only reason I could give this movie more than one stars. The movie was actually pretty solid, and the characters were kind of unique and not really familiar. The fact that there were some very funny references and bits of humor in the movie, along with the fact that there was
1	The music made me cry a lot, and its message of being open to all is interesting and touching. The dialogue was good, very sweet and funny. The story was interesting, I didn't really feel like I was listening to a lecture (despite the fact that the movie is titled "Love Story of the Century" which implies its subject) but that's ok. It has that feeling of "being lost behind the scenes". Still...its a long movie.
1	One of those things that can be just what you want. I found it very interesting. The acting is excellent. The editing is great! The sound effects are great on occasion. My only problem was the story itself. It seems to be a "love story" but it seemed very cliché, especially on its first half, which makes it really hard to get a hold of. The way you end the movie does a good job of not letting you get that far. It was fun. I wish it had a nice ending.
1	I have not yet finished it, but I watched it on TV and liked it. It's a quick story about romance to start you off on a beautiful and magical journey to the one you've always wanted. Also has a very romantic voice acting. Just a wonderful experience.
1	Another good movie, I love the look of it. I found the dialogue to be amazing. It had a wonderful ending.
1	Interesting story, not good at all. Very few scenes are actually good though and the story itself needs to get a ton of more action to actually get into any sort of plot. The story is so simplistic!
1	It was really good, it is a nice movie, the acting is great, as I said this is a very short movie though I was watching it on TV and enjoyed it.
1	It has some interesting ideas and a nice ending. I think it is one of the best things you can watch, but also not a big deal at all
1	The music is nice and I like the voice of it. Not perfect, but it is good enough to see I loved the movie and the film, the acting is good, but the story is so bland.
1	I liked the movie, not the music, but the story of it and it is a great story, it is kind of a cheesy one but the characters are good. Very good movie.
1	Very good movie, I just found it on youtube and liked it. Some interesting characters including the main star, he is also one of the most interesting characters I have seen. Great movie.
1	Not bad movie with an interesting set up, there is a certain charm about it and i thought he was good at the roles
1	I had expected a different movie, but I found something very similar to it, not one for the children. However I can see it as an intelligent comedy, but not one in the sense of how the story played out. Its nice, but it can leave some viewers feeling a bit cheated.
1	Great film, it was a good thriller or a suspense film. The characters are fantastic and the story tells quite the good bit, i just found it to be quite boring without getting to the good part though. I could say I liked it, but really...
1	Not bad for the price of admission. You get your money's worth and then some, and the movie itself is great.
1	I liked it, but I must say that the voice acting is a little cheesy for my taste, as in the movie I have never heard anything worse for the price of admission, and that the screenplay is a little dated, but still solid, and the actors cast is great, there are also interesting moments in it. But, overall, not the best movie, but very nice.
1	I just found the movie interesting through watching it on DVD and not on the film. If so, you would really need to see it in the theater.
2	The end: it was a long, slow, painful death...
1	Another black, fast paced comedy with a twist. You guessed it, it was going to happen in the end.
1	I'm really enjoying this movie. It reminds me of the time I was a kid watching this on TV with my dad, when we had the VCR in the living room and my dad took us to all the shows he'd recently watched on TV. I remember him saying how boring most of the shows we would watch on TV were for him because they were only 2 to 3 hours long. After watching this, and reading the comments, I'm starting to think I'm a lucky kid.
1	You should watch this movie if you want to keep the horror legacy alive. It is as awful as the reviews say it is, with even more horrific "frightening" sequences. It was a good movie to watch if you liked the first one. However, I can tell you that it is not worth your time. I think the studio wanted to keep it in the series, and a movie like this would have been more profitable than a sequel. Like the others on this list, I guess you should pay that the first one is really not worth it.
2	In the first film, a woman tries to get her estranged father to help with her case. But to no avail. After giving him everything, she decides to try and talk him out of it. She goes to a hotel room where her daughter is there with a man, who turns out to be Jason Blood (the same Jason in the Jason Goes to Hell movies) who wants to make his daughter his. After he leaves the girl says something to the young girl, who tells her father that he was there and she had to have sex with him. Later, the dad kills the man, who turns out to be a character from the television series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". I guess this character is supposed to be good - when he killed the guy he thought was a demon, he made him look like a monster. In reality, Jason was killing the person to get the girl he was supposedly in love with. I guess there is something wrong with an all-bad movie list.
1	a beautiful story, and a neat twist after the events of the last movie. Definitely worth checking up on a few more times...
1	I didn't know what to expect as I wasn't sure to what extent the characters had to change. I loved this movie, very much. They do a great job giving us characters that we care about. I think it's nice to see different perspectives. Some people will say they think the movie is like a "trilogy".... the thing is like a trilogy, as you will see. I really didn't want to review it, since I really can't watch it the first time around like I thought I would be. I didn't care for it at all and it felt like I'd forgotten it before I finished. I had to watch it again, and re-watch it over and over again. I just went through the damn thing twice already. It was alright.
1	excellent movie!
1	a great little gem. the way the film was structured - you got to know one scene only, then jump to the next one. this made the movie very entertaining, and it helped focus you on the characters. the ending was really nice. the pacing was really smooth, and after the events of the second one, you realized that he and his brother were dead. what more could you want?
1	great movie. I think the only issue was the last scene, where she took it upon herself to re-animate him, but her plan failed and he died.. :( I recommend
1	funny. a funny story, and a really good movie. I highly recommend checking it out, if you are into it.
1	well done! the show is pretty much on point. well done.
1	i love this movie! I really enjoyed it! there are some scenes I didn't like, especially around 2:30-3:00. but it's not all bad, the movie is definitely worth the money.
1	I loved this movie and the ending (in contrast to the movie as I saw it).
1	I like the concept, the characters are very well developed, the acting is great, the writing is excellent, the scenery is wonderful, the music is interesting... everything is good.
1	well done! great movie. I really enjoyed it. you will enjoy it.
1	I liked the movie. I think it was a solid movie for a little movie, though I did find the conclusion a bit off...
2	the ending was a bit off. the characters change a bit in other films, but it's not a complete 180.
2	there was too much blood in the plot of this movie. I didn't feel the same way about the ending, but didn't feel that it was a complete waste of resources for a movie of this type (the others also left some blood behind, this was quite evident).
2	good story, but...
2	too long.
2	I watched this after it was announced, and I was surprised by how many scenes there were that I didn't care about either - it kind of felt like watching a film on repeat a few times instead of a movie that is enjoyable.
1	The cast, the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography, the acting quality, this movie was fantastic.
1	The writing was fantastic!
2	It is certainly not the best movie of the year. As an intro I am impressed, but as a movie I just have to give it a negative. This movie is simply the most ineptly made, poorly directed and the worst of all of them. It is the worst of every genre: action, comedy, drama, mystery, drama, romance, music and the list goes on. So forget giving this movie a rating, it will be a waste of your time. I was pleasantly surprised how many people enjoyed this movie, but if you are not interested in doing this, it is not a movie to watch.
1	One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a really good movie.
1	A very funny, colorful movie, you just can't resist watching it, but to be honest it's not anything exceptional. It made me laugh several times.
1	A very decent comedy movie, although only the ending is very entertaining.
1	The only movie I really felt bad about. I thought the ending would be so cool, the whole movie just was an awful mess...
1	I feel like I have a bad feeling whenever I see this movie, it does what it does very well. The animation is really pretty and the music is nice.
1	The story is kind of typical of what you would see in classic old movies. Really good story line, however the animation is really slow, and the animation is often bad.
1	This film didn't have a great script. Its characters were terrible. There is no plot to begin with. Very cheesy.
1	They released a bunch of crappy pictures on the cover. What a shame. The film is not that bad… in fact I think it is quite excellent. But then, maybe I missed something. The film is not good. It's not even bad… but it's a bit ugly and cheesy… and I think the directors/production people should be ashamed of themselves. I know I am…
1	How many times have you seen a romantic comedy and wondered how they can even sell any tickets? The entire premise feels like your childhood dream coming true, but at the end it only gives you more disappointment. If the premise is this bad, why did they have so much trouble getting a movie made?
1	I have seen a lot of movies by Michael Mann. Most of them have been a disappointment. This latest (2010) was a real disappointment… not fun and very dated.
1	This film has so many very bad aspects. It is not good at all, most times it even makes me angry thinking it is bad. In fact I got some "awesome" comments in my Facebook. You can really tell there is an ulterior motive behind this movie. There are at least 4 different directors working in this production, one of which is a bad choice. The art director has a habit of giving the movie very unrealistic, but attractive color schemes, which does not seem to fit with the original color scheme. All in all, if you have not watched this movie yet, why not? You will be so happy you took the risk and watched this...
1	I do not understand how this movie is titled "Saving Private Ryan", because it is totally lame, no matter what anyone tells you. No matter what anybody tells you, this movie will not stop trying to convince you that it is going to. This movie contains absolutely nothing new, there's nothing "special" going on in there either. So, if you find oneself bored by these boring "movies" then just close your eyes, put the popcorn in the bag, and move on.
1	This one is a shame, it does not deserve a four-star rating so I'm giving it three and a half stars, because of three things: 1) The dialog is awful. 2) The "movie plot" is really nothing out of the ordinary (I'm talking about the story, not the way in which the movie is presented). 3) The plot is just "one day one guy fights another one" and that's it. No story, no direction, no anything.
2	I've hated every film this year. Nothing can compare to it, not on its own merits, or even as a stand-alone offering. It's like watching a series that I thought had no redeeming qualities, and then I was shown the second installment and realized that my hatred was unfounded. "Trouble with the Curve?" It's my favorite movie.
1	I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the director, Jim Jarmusch, is one of America's greatest live stage talent, as evidenced in the films he's produced since 2005. So I appreciate his work enough to give him a high rating--even though the film's very premise is the worst thing possible for a live-action feature.
1	"It's Like Being in Love" was the most compelling love story I've seen my entire life.
1	There's nothing too bad about this film, but it's so good it's like it's on the edge of success.
1	This is a very good movie (albeit, not a very good film about a very creepy girl). In short it is not a horror film. It is a great film about a woman who becomes haunted. I was somewhat worried about how it could be judged as a horror film because there are lots of jump scares to be had. However, there are only about 3 shots where I would call it over, and most of those are simply in the climax. (One notable jump scare is from an exterior shot of a house. In the last one the camera pans so close to the house that he almost cuts to it through what would be an open window.) It was a long film that you can skip if you enjoy the jump scares. I really appreciated the subtle use of close ups of the faces of the girls and did not feel that the effects worked. However, this was probably my least favorite movie on the list. If not it would have definitely been at the top. It has all the hallmarks of the horror genre - creepy girls, jump scares, and a lack of any real suspense. The story is okay, and the style that the character wore (a witch's hat) and the costume make any resemblance to a witch seem just about believable. I feel that the story would go on to be quite popular with teenagers if it was written and acted by a woman.
1	This film is not so much a comedy as a story driven adventure, the story is not based in reality however we are left with the story nonetheless to appreciate the characters. A good premise for a film, I would like to see more movies inspired by this style.
2	I find this movie extremely offensive and offensive in every way. It is in my opinion one of the most repulsive productions I have ever seen. The racism in this movie is so extreme that it is repulsive to the point that I actually had a hard time watching it. This film is a pure waste of time and one that I will never see another one of.
1	I find the acting to be top-notch in this movie, and the film is completely self-conscious. This movie is a very disturbing movie but the overall message is actually quite poignant and good. One of my favorite movies of the year so far.
1	I found the message to be very good in this movie and it was handled very well. We hear more about the horrors of racism and the things people go through in our society than we have in a long time. The actors did a fine job, even after all of the racism is brought up.
2	I found this film to be in no way a comedy and as such I feel that it was unnecessary and should be given additional credit for that. The racism towards blacks in this movie was quite excessive and the character's actions were rather out of touch with reality and how it should be depicted. If you like this movie then I suggest you be a little bit more sensitive towards racism in the future.
1	The acting was great in this movie. The movie itself was a horror, (although the humor comes in much needed to balance out the terror) although the messages were true and were presented eloquently that all the viewers in the entire world would love it.
1	This movie is the greatest thing I have ever seen in any movie theater. This movie is funny and the actors are not the norm. The movie was shot on the RED camera and every bit of humor, comedy, blood, gore, etc... was captured in the movie. The cast of actors was awesome and the actors did a great job and it never felt like a real movie. All i did to myself in this movie was just sit and relax and enjoy the journey. One of the best movies (and the best horror and thriller movies to date) and I believe it is the perfect movie to set for the summer.
1	This movie was good, however, it was very very much like the movie it portrayed. Very much like something from my nightmares. I found the horror aspect to be disturbing and the rest of the film was good, but as i have said, it is a very strange movie, it is not for everyone but I thought it was definitely worth a watch. This was an enjoyable film to watch which I wish I could find a better one for on another website.
2	I found this movie to be offensive and I didn't care for the fact that it had such disgusting scenes. The acting was well done and the film was very sad to see, however, i felt that it was a poor attempt to bring up the black issue. I do not like seeing this type of movie since I hate all manner of violence and even though I might like to see it again, i do think the film is going to be difficult for a majority of people to enjoy. I think i had a hard time watching and I hated the way this movie dealt with race. I think it is an offensive and reprehensible attempt at trying to have a black movie, but i can only
2	I didn't enjoy this one at all. But that might just be me. I was going down a path of mindless watching and just watched it over and over. The humor in the movie was too absurd to do well as a comedy. You'll be entertained and entertained by the ridiculousness of the film. When all the characters in a film are making up their own stories how come the world of the movie doesn't end? It's like that movie did have no end so why bother with the rest of the movie? When the movie starts to seem like a joke and I am sure you'll be more entertained by the jokes then the rest of the movie. When all the characters are running around in circles, jumping off cliffs, screaming, singing, and having a great time in their own personal world. When the world is being destroyed, you're not laughing at the destruction, you're laughing with the destruction. I honestly would have never laughed at the destruction of a city, the destruction of a village, or the destruction of mankind. Instead of enjoying these laughs, I was just too distracted to enjoy the movie. I'm sure you could tell this was a very immature review, and I certainly could not help myself, but when you see just how immature I was, I had to stop and explain why I was so immature. Maybe no one else will agree, but to all of those who disagree, I think you're crazy. Don't be so damn immature. Rating 10
2	I'm tired of how well-known aliens are in Hollywood. If you think about it, this little-known race was one of very few that really existed in the late 1960s.
2	So what? These aren't really aliens. But some of the movie was filmed using actors with actual human characteristics. The aliens had no life. They gave little reasons for how they looked, but that was all.
2	This movie did contain some awesome alien scenes. But the rest of the movie just felt kind of like a poorman's remake of Alien. I could have given this one a grade of 1. The action scenes were good, but the plot was so confusing that you couldn't decide if the aliens killed the person or the person killed the aliens.
2	The story was almost as bad I don't trust the original story I have to keep watching The Aliens, I have to keep watching.
2	The alien had a weird name. He started shouting and talking and we are not allowed to see this action scene, I had to skip it. But he did look cool!
2	This film actually felt like a retelling of Alien, although the humans have to fight and the aliens have a kind of special power to fight and the humans win.
2	My son asked me why would people do that to us when they can do something very nice. I said, "I don't know, because nobody wants to die."
2	I had no idea what the film was about from the trailers, and I was just wondering why nobody has put any aliens in the film.
2	Okay so for the most part, a lot of the movie was just running and moving, with no real action, but that's because I'm not a fast runner, I run very slowly. The movie went from 4 hrs 15 mins to about 3 hrs 25 mins and I ran a decent 6 hrs.
2	This movie had a number of bad things going for it, to start with. The main problem with the movie was that it did not have any dialogue whatsoever. As if it did not have enough action to make up for that! The rest of the movie is just like a crappy prequel/reboot to Alien and I was tired.
2	No matter what the plot was you could not help but be interested. It was all about the aliens. The aliens are not so cool the other aliens looked cooler…
2	I had a bad feeling as they pulled this off, I knew it was going to be a cheesy disaster.
1	What the hell did I expect? This film has really great action. It was well acted and the story was not bad. The action was well acted and the story was really interesting. But the movie didn't do anything. There was no climax. And so they kept making the people who really wanted more aliens like me happy. All of the movie got a B except for the ending, which was terrible
1	Okay okay.. the ending was great, and it was very interesting. All of the aliens survived the crash. A few of the aliens seem to have been on fire after their crash. But not so much. There were some cool scenes between the humans and the aliens. And there were a few aliens fighting, with the humans trying to kill/take away the aliens. I'm not just talking about space and shooting, because the humans do some cool things too. I mean, a few cool aliens make the movie even more cool.
1	All the cool aliens seem to have a little girl in the first 4 minutes of the film, and I think it worked! Everything was about the aliens not wanting to kill any more humans. The humans would not let them. Maybe it is really a good story to give them that, but it was so long and boring. And then the aliens were all in a cage on a space ship and the story ended. It felt like a poorly made prequel.
2	How can you leave out the action so much?
1	I enjoyed this movie very much, and am very familiar with all of the actors, and the location. There's something that I find about the whole war experience that is so amazing, and so wonderful, I can't help thinking of it when I am watching a horror film. Just a thought, isn't it?
1	This movie is so great, the characters are so well developed, and most of all...
2	this movie is ridiculous, it is boring, and I don't even know how to rate this movie, but I will go down 10 for fun. That is how much I like it.
1	A very good movie and the director is really talented and has done some great work for decades. Highly recommended.
2	I know, but it's not hard to see why this movie was so unpopular. I guess it is just about the amount of gore on film. It's boring, but I won't judge. So here's a brief summary. You know, things that are actually interesting, like a couple of women's love affairs being interrupted by a man who turns out to be a serial killer. The scene that was cut was the most entertaining. The people who took the video have really good taste. They did it for years.
1	This film is so much larger and more challenging for our understanding of what racism can be. It also has a huge amount to say about the way that our culture and society have affected African-American culture in the past and is still impacting us today. To be clear, I am not a racist but I can see how this film can be an easy target for those who would like to see it as a critique of all negative stereotypes of African-Americans. I found it a very fun, uplifting and entertaining film and I would highly suggest it to anyone who cares to watch a story that questions the power that prejudice can hold over people.
1	This film is wonderful in its originality and is based on one of the most beloved children's books ever written. It teaches an important message to young children, namely to be kind to others. Although this film is a bit dark, there are positive aspects to it. Yes, the characters are a bit despicable but I always wonder what people in that position and their lives would have been like and how different their choices would have been. Also, I appreciate that the film doesn't include some of the more graphic scenes that are often depicted in movies and other media. The film itself is not so much about how the characters behave but rather the message it brings to those who might have been a bit too lenient with their children.
1	It is a great story and really a powerful statement. A big thank you to a woman who shared this review saying, "The only time I've ever hated being white is when I was a child growing up in Texas. It took me a long time to accept that the way I was treated was because of our skin color, not genetics. Now I understand that, too. Please don't try to turn this into politics. If it was about politics, I would be doing the same thing, but it's about something else."
1	I am sorry to say that there really is no great thing that I saw this week.
1	A film that is a wonderful commentary on racism and racism in America.
1	This movie looks like the type of horror story, a horror movie, that all of us, all white folks like to watch. I loved the story and was very entertained by it.
1	I was really interested in the plot and its twist, and how it relates to the horror of some of the stories that have been told (some of them horror stories, actually) in the past, but I just couldn't put my finger on it because I am a hopeless romantic (I've been called that in the past) and I was just never satisfied with any horror story I've seen. The twist is fun but could've been more. I'd have much preferred watching someone's heartbreak and pain, rather than some of the monsters and gore-fest.
1	It's hard to make a list of "all time great movies" because these are just not movies that are ever going to get made again, are in some way or another made for one specific genre of audience or audience segment or interest, regardless of their merits. They aren't necessarily good, either, particularly when you combine all of the components - themes, characters, genre, etc, in a really satisfying way. I do like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, though...it's just not my cup of tea. It
1	Not bad, just not a sequel to my two favorite X-Men films (not bad at all, but not a sequel to either).
1	Good action scenes and good character dynamics. The original is very good.
1	Good action, good acting, even better special effects and character interactions....more of that.
1	Good action...pretty good special effects...nice character interactions.
1	OK action on an underwhelming script, and it's not the original or an X-Men 2.
1	OK action. The new one is much better, and it's not the best X-Men film
1	OK action. Nice special effects. Nice character interactions.
1	Good action...and so much better than their first effort. And it's better for that.
1	The first film was a great film, but the sequel has nothing at all to do with it except sound a very bad sequel. And no one has any interest at all in a movie they don't like. This isn't a bad flick...it's a bad movie that isn't a great flick. So many of the people who gave it 4 stars are either new or are just being picky.
1	Just a mediocre movie--especially when the director and stars can't make the movie work. And the special effects couldn't do it any better.
1	Good action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3 installment
1	Great action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3 installment.
1	Not good action, though a decent film overall.
1	Not much action and not much character interaction.
1	Nice action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3 installment.
1	Not well done...not a good flick.
1	Not good but not the worst. It's a good movie and the characters are very well-developed.
1	Good special effects and interesting character interactions. The story is good and makes for a good movie even though they spent most of the movie trying to make their story work.
1	Good special effects...and special effects really make a good movie.
1	Great special effects...and interesting characters
1	Great special effects...and interesting characters.
1	Bad special effects...but character interaction and special effects really make a great movie.
1	Poor special effects...but character interaction and special effects really make a great movie.
1	Good action...and so much better than their first attempt and the first X3
2	This version is the first film that you won't get the director's name on the poster. It seems the original version couldn't be reproduced, so it's the first version of this film, that didn't get any credit from director Howard Hughes. Also interesting is that this version is not for sale anymore. The only other copy (with some color and sound) that exists in private hands.
2	This film was used in the National Association Of Motion Picture Theatres (National Association) program. Also featured in several of the motion picture specials and documentaries for kids.
2	This is one of those films where it seems that all that was great about the original wasn't the same anymore. But in a good way! You're given an alternate view of the protagonist, but you also get a good amount of interesting material, while still sticking to the same themes. You still know you're seeing a 'original' version. This version was shot in color and has a soundtrack. Also the score is not as bad as the other version.
2	There's no such thing as bad news in movie. This version looks pretty good, if a bit bland, and it has some great scenes at the end. It's very hard to say which scenes were better. In all fairness, there were some very fun scenes. I like the song, though. The movie is pretty great. Very fast and exciting. I enjoyed it!
2	There are a lot of things wrong with this film. It seems a little out of hand. As the title suggests, people are given very little information, and they have to work it out for themselves. That's not bad as such, but the story is not very interesting. Although I enjoy the movie, this version is really an afterthought that didn't get enough attention or publicity.
2	It seems like the original was also made only for the US market so there are some differences. That sounds like poor decision to me, but I'm trying to be fair here. Overall, it's a pretty good film, but there aren't many people who see it.
2	You can't do a bad movie without making this film's theme less-popular. If it could have been made for American audiences, then this film could have stood for one of the best horror movies ever made. If it were not for this, it wouldn't be such a bad movie anymore. This version was originally made for European markets. Also features some special effects not found in the US version.
1	This is a very popular movie in the US and is now very appreciated abroad. An old school gothic-horror version with a nice score by Frank Zappa. Also there's no English subtitles so you have to speak the American version if you plan to watch it in other European countries. For me, the whole thing was pretty boring. I don't think it got anywhere.
1	This movie was released in Germany in 1969. This version has a wonderful, and mostly humorous score by Wolfgang Stuhlmayer. The film is not very well known and probably won't find itself getting much attention. This version has a nice ending, though.
1	This movie does what it says on the tin. It's a cheesy romance comedy and a little slice of life that does a great job at highlighting the love that's prevalent in Japan. As I mentioned before, the English audio is just as good. Plus, the Japanese actors are very likable. As for this particular movie's message, it's simple and doesn't go in crazy directions, just telling the story. I am definitely loving this movie because I was hoping for something different with this one from start to finish.
2	It just doesn't work. Not once does it even come close in terms of the story or the action. It's too silly and too far down the toilet to really live up to a PG13 rating. The ending is predictable for a first film. I thought the last shot was super clever, but not the final shot, which is just a silly piece of music. Overall, the film was bland and disappointing.
1	I want to point out the fact that this is based on a true story. It's really a wonderful movie.
1	this movie is great.
2	A classic from the late '70s, and a great American sci-fi film (or horror film). A good bit of slapstick humor, the best actors and the best action scenes. There is one major problem for me with the film. The ending is totally nonsensical. It plays out like a TV show ending in a week. And there's no explanation for what happened. Why no end credits? You'll know after you watch. The movie is pretty good, but not very funny or interesting. And the action is well done!
2	Another nice movie which has great music, mood, and action. The story is really quite ordinary and interesting. It lacks the funny moments and the dramatic action.
2	I was looking for something fun, something action packed, something with an interesting story, and what did I get? A movie that would make any teenager think that all this action was funny. This movie is all the rage, for it's very good for teenagers. The story is really interesting and a lot of laughs. The movie has good music, great acting, and fantastic action. For a teenager, this movie was the best of its day. It's a fine thriller about a spy coming of age, the danger of working, and the fun that can be had with bad guys! I'm also a big fan of this movie. It's one of my early favorites.
2	Another interesting one, really. You know, "A Star Is Born"? Okay, it ain't the best, but the title says it all, "Starz". I think it's a great film, and it's a nice sequel to "Star Wars". The movie follows a group of military cadets, trying to figure out how they can keep their world a secret from their parents.
2	A movie you don't watch until a few days before or after a major football game in which there are lots of big commercials.
1	It's a beautiful movie. It's been in release for a while now. I love the color, and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. I think it's a good movie to watch to clear your mind.
1	The great ending. Great scene, very good ending, and great ending. The camera is very natural.
1	A great film with great action.
1	One of my favorites. It has that special kind of fun you are interested in, a nice action movie.
1	Really awesome action movie (or horror movie). One of my favorite action movies.
1	"The Fly" is a fantastic horror film. An amazing film. A really special film.
1	Awesome and a bit dark. A good one. A really great film.
1	Another great sci-fi sequel. Another great action movie, with awesome sound.
1	Another great Sci-fi sequel. Cool movie. "Alien 2" was always my favorite.
1	Another great Sci-fi sequel. The plot is a bit complicated.
1	Another great sci-fi sequel. And the music is awesome. Great movie.
1	Another good sci-fi sequel. Great movie.
1	Another terrific sci-fi sequel. Very nicely done. I really enjoy watching it.
1	Another wonderful sci-fi sequel. Great movie.
1	Another great sci-fi movie. Very cool and well directed with great humor and cool music.
1	Another great action sequel. I love the movie, all the way through. Very good.
1	Another great Sci-Fi sequel. A great movie!
1	Another great Sci-Fi sequel. Another very well directed movie with great humor and cool music.
1	Another great Sci
2	I can't believe they gave this a 9... It's very strange. I was very curious to see if its movie star would leave me with the impression they will not give a shit about us, but it was all a setup for a really interesting ending...
1	An interesting look at life. The director of this film, who I will call "Zuzi", has found a way to depict what it's like to be young and gay on screen. The character has never been given any attention until now, which is why the ending is so amazing.
1	A really good little film. It's a funny story of two brothers from different religions going to a summer camp, and all that goes with it. Very funny and also good to watch!
1	This is a very interesting film. The story itself and the actors are excellent. However, the movie itself is not as beautiful as some of the other movies I've seen. The movie could be more consistent in its presentation, but overall it's a masterpiece!
1	An interesting film that focuses on how we all want to belong but all we do is fight for that. Not everything is real and just because an item has no real human life is no reason it shouldn't be enjoyed.
1	This movie is a real pleasure! It isn't perfect but I actually really enjoy the acting. The cinematography and acting are all very good and it makes the characters more convincing. Overall, I was surprised to find such a talented crew and people who actually love their work. They love what they do.
1	This is some incredibly talented and thoughtful acting from two characters. Very different and very real.
1	An extremely good film that is so well made it's a wonder I still watch it...This movie is amazing with great acting and visuals
1	It's a really good film. The director took a unique and interesting idea and turned it into a really great story. It's a pretty complicated story. The movie itself is pretty good! 
1	This is a very strange film. It's a very interesting and dark picture, about a family of gay teens that have a secret. A very strange story!
2	this movie was released on October 20th, 1998, it was one of the best science fiction films ever made. it was shot on location in Utah and was an incredible, stunning piece of art.
2	i wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, but it's not terrible. it really is just average science fiction, with some fantastic effects mixed in. everything works well, but i'm not sure how to rate it. i think i'd give it a 3 (not great) because of everything good, but i can't say it was terrible.
2	it seems this movie is mostly used for propaganda or for people to give out to the masses. i can guarantee you those groups are not going to love the movie, they won't enjoy the experience of seeing some weird, strange, and bizarre aliens who are mostly useless. they'll just spend most of their time getting their asses whooped by the bad guy and the aliens can get a 5 if they're in a movie setting.
2	this movie got the lowest rating on IMDB and I don't know if that's a reflection of its ratings which are high and a lack of reviews or maybe its due to the fact that it is made by the same company as the other movies in the series. I don't see much of an improvement in the show after half way through but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
2	The story is good in essence, but the ending can't be described so it can't be rated as good. It seemed almost as if the ending wasn't supposed to be what it ended up being and the movie is boring and uninspired after it.
1	I'm sure this was intended to be a comedy but sadly for everyone this is not funny or interesting... but as it is an accurate depiction of a very real situation, I didn't want it to end like all the others. It has many moments like this. And to top it off, the ending really gets me and you can feel the tension building. Definitely a good romantic comedy!
1	This is a good movie but the romance was a bit too fake. Still, a must-see action movie. Definitely worth watching if you really like the action genre.
2	A great rom-com, however the romantic comedy did not hold up.
1	I must say that I am very impressed with this film, because it's a really good version of the classic The Three Coopers movie. It's true-life story of a group of friends, that gets a bit bigger than you can imagine. Even the characters in this film are a little bit different from the TV show. Also a great movie which you can watch at any time for a few minutes or even a full day.
1	It doesn't have a title and it's not quite finished, but it is absolutely one of the first "cinematic video games" to have one. It turns out to be a movie that makes fun of the whole genre of "cinematic video games" in the sense that it's like a parody of both "video games" in general, and "video games with a very low level of story and characters", and it has no rules for how it's supposed to take place, but as far as "video games" go, it's fairly well thought out. It's supposed to be a fun, silly thing made by a bunch of people. Most people would say that it's not funny at all, but it was, for a time, just an amusing story about a really stupid cartoon.
1	If you haven't seen it in a while, you might be wondering what the deal is with these movies. These movies are so hard to watch they are almost unwatchable. They are not funny, they don't have the right kind of humor, they are simply terrible movies. "Bad movies always take their names from a movie to describe the experience," said a young, talented comedian in the 1980's. "And, you know exactly what I mean. In the worst cases, the movie plays like a game, because you lose whatever the point was in the first place. The movie itself is an act of violence, an act of degradation, an act of humiliation." So, I guess that's why this review is really the best.
1	 This movie was bad, and it was made by people who didn't know how good or bad they were. How good?  Well, they didn't know, and the "good" they did know would cause them to lose almost the entire story of the plot. They didn't try hard enough to make something worth watching, and just wasted all the fun.  Also, it's made by people who don't speak Italian, so they are only doing bad stuff in a crappy language. And no, neither of them is Italian.
1	It's really hard to describe how bad this movie is. It's the worst bad movie I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies. The "movie" itself is a terrible mix of "Bad Movies" with an absolutely awful bad song.
1	The voice acting is terrible. The story is terrible. The characters are terrible. The story/characters/actors are bad. The characters are bad, and the story is even worse to the point you wish it were bad because you feel bad for the poor characters you've had to put in this horrible movie. The end result is an entire movie with a totally bad and dull ending, a few great scenes, and that song from the movie. It's like watching the last scene of the movie, it's so dull and bland. I hated the movie.
2	A young lady tries to keep her friends out of trouble as a nun grows more obsessed with her.
1	In the beginning, the mother in this film looks almost completely normal, but soon turns into a crazy monster. The girl is extremely vulnerable and scared. She even tries to drown herself, as it sounds like the closest her boyfriend is going to get.
2	The movie in this category is just a bit too crazy to put on the short list with all the other horror classics out there. The entire movie feels like it starts off in a very light and sweet setting with the mother crying, then slowly escalates at a rapid pace into a more and more ridiculous level. The whole movie is just too over the top to be entertaining.
1	One of our favorite features of this collection includes the director's comment at the end of the film, "If this movie was actually about the film, we'd need to use the word 'buzzword.' " One can easily imagine a child's description after sitting through the entire film. As the film reaches its hilarious climax, the film's author said this, "And then all the children cried, then everyone gave up on cinema, so it was just a joke. And I thought this movie would be funny if it was actually about the film." A very interesting film at its very best. It's just too much and too over the top. You could easily call it one of the dumbest B movies you have ever seen.
1	This time we have four sequels, so in the beginning, we only see it as a group of guys in the woods, but soon we find out the movie isn't really about them and it all goes down at that same place on the same night.
1	A group of kids trying to save their dead friend's soul. But the soul is not with them and they don't want to get rid of it or give it over to the ghosts, so the group decides to go and kill the ghosts in a different manner.
1	A documentary about the Holocaust and the people who died. The director talks about the past, present, and future of humanity. Very moving.
1	A man tells a story of the war in Vietnam and how to solve the problem of how to protect a man. It was made in the 90s, and I've never heard anyone talk so highly of something so innocent and funny before.
1	An episode of The Simpsons that was put on a DVD set for the first time. It's an episode that takes the plot from The Secret of NIMH, with the characters having their lives put in jeopardy, and then when Bart and Lisa save the day and stop the plot from happening, their lives, too, are put in jeopardy again. The joke of the episode is so well done, however, that it's a well thought out scene that has a lot of heart and is pretty much perfect. We have a few scenes where the writers try to get us to laugh, but our jaws literally dropped. The voice of actor Charles Grodin really brought me down, and I was so lost for words.
1	I don't think there is any movie like this because most of them are pretty boring and don't seem to live up to the amazing stuff that most directors do. David Lynch makes great work that people can enjoy.
2	A movie that looks like a bad old fashioned detective film set in the 60s? What the hell is that? There is one that looks like it could be the real life The Silence Of The Lambs so I am sure this is one of those films that is fake as fuck. And how did I waste $75? Did I get ripped off?
1	What a great show!
1	I have just watched this movie and it amazed me. The first three episodes of the whole show are wonderful and I think it will be a great tv show. What a pleasure to see David Lynch work again on this high energy format and I hope that he continues making other great art films. The show is a pleasure to watch with some great actors and the camera is absolutely spectacular. This is a great tv show that I hope will stay on the air for a long time.
2	Well this one was not that much fun. I expected so much. But it seemed to stay very on the same level to me.
1	It's hard to describe the style of this movie but if you want to know, it's a really good one.
1	I am a film lover. I loved this movie! I also loved the second one.
1	I really do not see this as an awesome art movie or anything like that. I see it as quite a different art style.
1	I'm not really sure I can describe this one. It's a wonderful mystery movie.
1	This one made me laugh a lot.
1	I enjoyed this, but a lot of it ended up feeling like filler. I think it is a good movie. I just wish it was more like the first couple episodes, but all in all it did have a wonderful ending.
1	If you love the film "Funny Games" and want to make the perfect movie with no filler, then watch the very first episode of this movie here, which I thought was very fun. Very well put together. Not very good but very good. It just doesn't have any originality.
1	This was a fun movie to watch and a lot of fun to make. I had a lot of fun with the camera!
1	This one was pretty great.
1	I'll watch "Lost Highway" next!
1	I am a big fan of the story about a young woman who gets drunk and gets into an accident. You will know the end because it will probably tell you exactly how it ends.
1	Good episode.
1	A great movie. I did enjoy it.
1	I loved the ending. It was a great ending.
1	Good movie but a bit boring and dull in some places.
1	I'm glad I watched this movie because it was a good movie and I really liked it.
1	I watched a good movie.
1	Nice job! I think this is one of the best movies I've seen.
1	The ending was just fine. Also the movie is really good.
1	Great movie. I really enjoyed the ending.
1	A very good movie for fans of the "Twin Peaks" series.
1	Really good movie.
1	Good movie. I found the ending boring and boring and that there was no real emotional payoff to the ending.
1	I really like this movie, but with the ending, it doesn't make much sense to me.
1	I liked this movie a lot, I hope they pick it up again someday.
1	A good movie, very enjoyable. I will watch it again soon. Very happy to see that Showtime is now going to start selling the show on DVD.
1	Good movie. This is a really good movie.
1	My opinion is: It's interesting
2	If it wasn't for the awful editing, this would be one of the top rated movies of the week!
2	Just not worth seeing that long.
2	A movie that is a poor attempt at a science fiction franchise. No idea about physics, just like Star Trek: <br /><br />It is a movie for children. I have no interest and don't want to see it.<br /><br />At first I laughed at it, then I was like, 'Wow, this is just like Star Trek. It's not bad. But it's lame.'
2	<br />Star Trek: <br />Star Trek: <br />In the 1990's there was a huge gap between the end of Star Trek and the start of Star Wars.<br /><br />It was an era with few Star Trek movies, so why did it take so long for someone to start a new series. Now people think this series is an abomination and they are going to kill it. I don't give a flying f*ck whether Star Trek is good or not. I'm so tired of being told something is good because it is a Star Trek movie.
2	Just because a film or video game is a "good movie" doesn't mean it's worth spending money on. I'm not sure who has this idea the most, but when it was released in 1999 and made money at the box office, I was not shocked.  I was horrified. This is not a "good movie" by any means. Although I think it would have made a good indie movie, it doesn't add up. It's over the top in a weird way. It's one of those films that is so over the top that it feels like a joke. I would classify it as being above-average. The plot is great. The premise is not. The humor is okay. The story is fine. The acting can be very pretty and very generic and very sad. If you're going to watch a bad movie, don't go to see a good one. Watch a bad movie made by idiots who hate their jobs, and then watch the second bad movie made by idiots who hate comedy.
1	This movie was released almost 10 years ago, but still makes for an awesome watch!
1	This has no scenes taken from or borrowed from any movies, tv series, novels, video games, anything. This is a unique and wonderful take on magic. It is not derivative in any way. And it is quite funny. Very funny. I will never make a mistake in a movie again.
1	It's a very well-written, very funny movie. Also, it is very funny.
1	I was totally expecting to find this and be in disbelief. My first thought was, "Oh no...this can't be." Then I thought it was so funny I wouldn't regret it any. I was in for a big surprise. I loved it the first time I saw it. 
1	A true classic from the "goodie Bollywood".
1	The story really grabbed me. It's a very complex movie and can even be difficult to understand if you can't watch it in English. The dialogues are great, the dialogues for the characters are nice and the plot is very intriguing.
2	I haven't heard about this movie, but I would like to see some reviews.
2	Really bad, and really poorly filmed. Don't believe all the hype about this film... the ending just kind of looks like a fake movie that a group of idiots made. The plot is also ridiculous... it doesn by far the most ridiculous thing in the entire film. This will probably make it hard to watch even a few times.
2	I'd watch it if I like funny movies but I just can't. It's a little bit stupid, I guess, but really doesn't hold your attention and takes a lot of time.
2	The movie is overrated, not because I dislike it - I think it's a great film, but because it just takes so long to get to the end that I don't really care how good it is except at the end when the credits roll. It's just a matter of the film being overrated.
1	You could call this my favorite non-supernatural horror film of any of the films that I love. It definitely deserves that title. The plot can be a little slow, but if you're feeling it, you should watch it. It gets better and better with each viewing.
2	Good but I felt it was the movie that was being targeted by Disney and so I can't recommend it as being a "true" Disney movie. I found that it was very much a "Disney-styled" movie (i.e. animated or live action) and it lacked much in the way of characters/adventure. -Wally
2	Not bad in the movies, the story is bad. Nice cinematography, but in the end I don't see much meaning to the girls. But, I liked the story, I think they can live in some nice house with the best Thai friend you ever knew, who was born in Thailand and lived there for a couple of months.
1	Well if you like your Thai, this is another good choice.
1	It is a long story, but with an interesting and fun story, really different every time I watched this. And as usual, every Thai person I've known on the internet has said to me: "that is one of the best Thai movies!"
1	A nice movie that I enjoyed, not very different from the ones I had seen in the cinema. The ending really made me happy, it's almost a fairy tale ending.
2	Not to bad, but the movie looks like it is being made in 2001. It doesn't have that interesting cinematography. And the ending is not in Thai, and I think it was so bad it would be very difficult for them to translate it in an original film. To give you a hint, I have no desire to see any of these movies in our local cinema.
1	It is a strange movie, it is a strange story, different every time I've seen it. It's pretty good though, and although a movie, it does have some good jokes.
2	Very different from the typical Thai movie I have seen before. In this movie I saw a bunch of people being hurt and hurt a lot by a lot of people who seemed to think that they had the right to be hurt by these people. The entire story is very similar to the ones in the film "The Departed" (see below)
1	This movie is different from your typical Thai movie, it's the first time I've had Thai language, and I liked it a lot. I recommend it.
1	An intriguing story about a small town in Thailand known as Phajang, just like in the movie "The Departed" (see below), but with very different setting.
1	A lot of people have been talking about Thai movie about "the girl who didn't want to have sex," but this is not about that, this is about finding a man who won't have sex with you. As a boy his mother had to go to a prostitute every night to meet this boy, she didn't want to have sex with him but could not find the right guy, so she gave him this opportunity. The problem is that not one person actually accepts this chance when they first try to meet a man. But even if he doesn't want the relationship, he's still willing to start their relationship. It's complicated, and so I don't want to spend all the time explaining this with my readers, because they've seen many videos about this. But just in case you can't understand this, I suggest you watch at least one of the videos mentioned below.
1	I don't have a lot of experiences of Thai movies before this, but this was the first movie I saw from Thailand and it was entertaining, it's a good movie, but very different from anything else I've seen so far.
2	A little bit different from the typical movies, it has a very small village in Thailand, and I actually think that's really nice. It is a beautiful movie, but I think if it wasn't filmed on location in Thailand, then it would not be interesting.
1	A lovely film about a beautiful life and an old man's life. Don't let that one word fool you; this is not an "artsy" romantic comedy, but rather a very good, romantic film.<br /><br />
1	This is a very well acted film about a family where young daughter finds herself growing up on the wrong side of the law. I'm very interested in seeing the whole film, and so I will see it again (not for the end of the film). I don't know how "bogus" this would be for other girls to have seen in the same genre, but I find it interesting and amusing.<br /><br />
1	A wonderful and moving story about love and loss. Very emotional, with a beautiful music score. This film is excellent. If I were to only watch it once <br />
1	A very well acted film about a teenage girl with an extraordinary ability to get into trouble. I believe this movie is also about young people with extraordinary abilities, and there are two scenes that are particularly touching in that regard. It is not intended as a "teen-oriented" film, but it is definitely part of the film-going experience.</p>
1	For some people this may be a little much, but there is something really special about this movie, a movie that would never be seen by most people. For those people, you're lucky! I hope I'll see this movie again! It's the best, I promise!<br /><br />
1	A nice story of a family of four with a special power that can travel into the spirit world and try to change it. There are several wonderful moments when you feel the spirit around you. I am very curious to see how they will do it.<br /><br />
1	The beginning and the end are about the same time, at least that's how it seemed until I watched the last act, but the movie itself is an interesting experience and it will please most moviegoers. I wouldn't advise watching it out of order though.
1	A very good and moving story about love and a mother who doesn't forget her son on the first night with his new girlfriend. Very emotional and touching. This is a very interesting film and it will amuse you. I wish it had the opening scene this time around!<br /><br />
1	There were some great scenes of the two teenagers who were so close together, and I also liked how they had different personalities, and how they had their own way of being together. This movie does have good acting by a few people (the main cast is not large...), I find it more of an art house version of this, but it's good! This is a wonderful movie and will probably be seen again.<br /><br />
1	This is a very charming and very moving story about a guy who is dying and has another life. There are a lot of wonderful, and beautiful moments!<br /><br />
1	The art in "Les Misérables" is really something to behold. The cinematography is beautiful... the cinematography... I don't know how to explain this much, but there's this feeling in this movie for a few seconds if one takes the time to watch it. It's a very powerful feeling. But that won't tell the whole story. One of my biggest criticism is the direction in this movie. The direction is always really stiff to the point of annoyance in one scene and a bit to stilted in another. I don't get it but I'll give it a chance.
2	If you know the story, you already know that, this movie is only a story, nothing to do with real life. I think that was why I wasn't so enamored. I don't mean to be so critical but this movie is not like any other movie you see nowadays. It's too realistic, too simple, and all too stupid. It's so stupid that I didn't even buy a beer because I couldn't believe I watched this.. And I didn't finish for many hours and hours. The story was a farce and I was laughing while watching but watching this is something else. This is just plain stupid but it's not like the plot in "Balls of Fury" to even come close to this and the dialogues are terrible. In fact they were just plain horrible. And this is all for a story that doesn't even make sense. I just wish that a movie like this didn't exist in theatres but it did and I don't know why it's such a hit in the first place.
1	I am actually amazed by this movie because for a movie like "Les Misérables" the ending was not very interesting but I'm not going to say anything about that. It is just a movie for the most part and if you liked the first one this one should not disappoint. Well that's my honest opinion based on so much other stuff but please be prepared for a stupid piece of trash.
2	Oh yes it's that stupid stuff! You saw the ending and it did not even come close to satisfying. You got an idea of what happens and then there is nothing to see after that. The ending was so lame and so poorly delivered that it just hurt. I really hate the whole thing. I really dislike the entire movie... And I think everyone should be quite familiar with this style of writing. Please learn to love it first before you try to make stupid movies.
1	This movie is just a very dumb movie. It just doesn't do anything good. If it's anything like the first one, you will hate it even less. The reason I found this movie entertaining is that it didn't have any plot. You just watch it, there's nothing special going on. It just has many random scenes but the story is so bad that there's no point. The characters are so generic. One of my favorite lines of the movie is the one about how he doesn't want to be a soldier but he has to be a soldier but if he's a soldier he's not much more than a mercenary. Seriously I don't even have words for that line. The movie is so dumb that there's no point at all to this as an entertainment.
2	Oh how this is a stupid movie... Yes it's funny but that is the very last thing the movie does. The storyline is so stupid that if anything I would say "this is a parody and not a movie of real life". The whole thing is just dumb.
1	In short, the movie has a simple story and is a great movie for a Christmas watching. The sound is great for such a short film and the picture is nice and all but the story just didn't add much. If there's a real theme in "Les Misérables" it's that everything happens for a reason or else he's a fool. The movie just has a few scenes where something happens and then you are left with
2	This movie is way over the top and will make children cry. It's an action movie, so that's not a problem. With action, there is always violence, so even a child should be able handle the plot. It might sound like a bad review, but the movie has such interesting moments that I'm still trying to shake off those teary eyes. If you can give this one 3 stars, you will be happy you did.
1	For the family, this was an action/adventure movie with a little romance. I could see this being an excellent way to introduce the family to the world of video games.
1	This movie takes place in the future. It has elements reminiscent of the first two Jurassic Park movies, and a cool concept. It's entertaining and fun to watch.
2	All too soon I would have been caught dead watching this movie. This movie is full of plot holes. The people in the film were not people at all. They were aliens. The movie was really stupid and it played out like a big bad from The Matrix. I'm not a bad person, but something tells me this movie is bad on purpose.
1	I am not a huge horror buff, but I am a die hard science fiction fan. I like movies like Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien, and even Gattaca. So when I am given the chance to watch a science fiction movie, I take advantage. This movie takes me out of the movie and into the future. I like the concept of the movie. Its a mystery and in it you can find something like this in real life!
2	The character development in this movie sucked me right along with the movie. I would have preferred seeing more character development and some other fun parts of the movie. Unfortunately, the character development is too little and too often. The character was well developed, however what you see here feels like a one shot story. This movie is probably one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. And I really like movies that take place in the future, I like them when I can see a future where people have evolved to the point that they can think for themselves, they are not forced by some government imposed social order. Maybe in the future...
1	My wife and I watched this movie together after we went into Star Wars week. While we haven't watched it together since, I still enjoyed it. The story was interesting. The acting was great. I could tell it was well made. 
1	The story took me off the sofa and back into the world that Star Wars gave me. I really liked this movie. This was a fun mystery, with intriguing questions and the characters were all great to watch. 
2	This movie was bad! This was what happens with bad science fiction movies. I thought the plot was awesome, but the whole "in space you can kill anybody you want" idea bored me and it kept me from enjoying the rest of the movie. Most of the movie was unnecessary, and the bad writing kept it from being entertaining. This is a mediocre bad science fiction movie. 
1	My favorite science fiction movie. An awesome mystery with incredible characters. The actors are great, and the story flows nicely. What else can you ask for?
1	This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. It has some interesting concepts and is entertaining, but the whole thing is horrible in every way imaginable. The movie has the basic flaws of many movies and I'm unsure where it is going. I just didn't like it.
1	The plot is not all that interesting at all. The characters are pointless and one can only guess who the author is writing for at the end. It is not a complete bad movie I would say, but it is pretty awful.
1	I give this movie 4 for a movie, I gave it 3.5 for the plot and 2.5 for the characters. If I had to put it to 1 or 2 I would like it more, I just don't like it.
1	I honestly wish my DVD drive had two USB ports on it, because I could have watched this movie twice! It was fun when I made it, but it was a complete waste of fun and was terrible. I thought it was very interesting from the get go, but to see the film repeated after viewing it, was a total waste of time.
1	I think the director is great. I loved reading his stories as a child. There was always something good to latch onto in the writing from that story. In the end, he managed to write good parts for what was intended only to be a generic film with a generic writing. I really enjoyed this film, it was good, it was bad, and it was mediocre in the end.
1	the most interesting part of the film, I had a different thought about it when after the 5th viewing. I was not surprised or satisfied by anything the movie has to offer.
1	I liked it because of the character development of each character. I liked the concept of this movie, but it all started to fall apart in the final scene.
1	I loved the characters, story, premise, director... I was excited when I watched this movie. It was funny, it had a decent plot, interesting characters, and was a good time. But the ending is just... it just ended... It was not good at all. It was as if everything was taken to a extreme the second half of the movie. The second half of the movie felt like I was watching for the first time. I just didn't have the energy to watch the second half over and over again. No surprise there, I think. I did like the movie and I will be watching it again, but it was not worth paying to watch for the second time over.
1	its a great movie but the ending ruined it
1	I love this movie from the opening of the movie. then they went from it being funny to being a really bad movie. The ending however it was not bad. It was really enjoyable however the ending was so badly executed because of it. The ending basically said that this was a bad film but if you watch it again, the story would be really great. If you are going to watch this film, I would recommend taking it to a friend they could help you with the writing. The writing on this film is terrible. I didn't like it though my daughter did.
1	great idea i hope it works on some platforms.
1	Very nice idea. I really hope it will find some audience, or at least at least one of the ones who liked a certain anime.
1	I just loved it!
1	The idea was great and I loved the concept of this movie. But the ending was actually even worse. I didn't feel the movie I should have given something else of this type of movie but I will see it again.
2	The worst thing I ever thought, but then again I'm a bit of an idiot for doing that.
1	This film is very different then anything I've seen before.
1	Very good, well acted, very funny and well made. My god this is a great film!
2	I was a terrible person but this film made me feel better. I found myself crying while watching this. The film was really good.
1	Excellent movie, the art and music made it worth watching!
1	This film is a very good looking film. I liked it. It was good. I could see why so many people like it. There were some parts where it seemed like it was going to suck but it was well done. 
1	One of my all time favorite films. The story is very well written and the acting was superb. I'm very pleased. The action was pretty good and the music was great. The story was very entertaining and fun to watch, I enjoyed it all. 
1	Some movies made a point of showing women in a certain way, but this movie managed to surprise me a lot. I did not expect what this movie would do to my understanding of the idea of woman's role in society.
1	This movie was my main inspiration to become a better cinephile, particularly when I was having a hard time. Some movies make that point clear, but at no point did I realize the depth and meaning of this movie until you watch it. I can think of very few movie's that were so clear in meaning. A movie like this, especially one as large and complicated as this one, is hard to understand. That is actually just the point of this movie, to allow you to grasp the enormity of things without having to give up anything you've learned about it and simply watching it.
1	As always in this review, I was not a fan of this movie for a number of reasons. I am just as annoyed as all you readers at this point about the fact that it came off as so repetitive as some of the reviews give it credit for being. It is just too much of a repetition for me.
2	I just didn't like the entire film. Some were positive, but most were not. It all just felt very, very repetitive and predictable.
2	One of the best female led action movies of the decade. The special effects are incredible, all of the bad guys work hard, the action sequences always kick ass, the supporting characters and villains are all quite well executed, and the dialogue is hilarious!
1	I was not a fan of this movie (if I had been a fan, I would have given a more positive review). The way the story was told was bad. It was very story driven with a lot of action. It only focused on one side, so not as many scenes of other characters. There is none of the character interaction I remember from the first movie, aside from some very specific dialogue, and then it starts again. This was not the movie for me, and I was more disappointed then than anything. I would call this a 10% movie, but there are so many better movies out there, in my opinion.
1	This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and an absolute must see if you want to see a good female lead. The acting is superb, the story is very well written, and the writing, particularly in the comedy scene, is truly genius.
1	A hilarious film that is both funny, and tragic at the same time. The cast is excellent and it just blows you away. The story and acting are terrific.
1	A great satire on the status quo and the politics of it. I enjoyed it a great deal, and I thought it did a really good job at showcasing the absurdity of life. The whole thing is beautifully written, and has a real lightness to it.
1	 I used to watch a lot of shitty shitty movies. Then I read a book about a time period where everyone in a different movie theater is going to make a bad movie, and I decided to make one myself for fun. Then it sort of worked.
2	 It's funny I made two such films, if they made you laugh at all then your taste in films has grown a little, but I think it actually makes you uncomfortable and makes you angry. You have to be careful not to watch this one all the time unless you really want to make yourself laugh. Not a horrible movie, but it's a good example of a movie that doesn't make its audience happy at all.
1	This is an epic comedy. It is a very sad movie, but there is light happiness in it. Good acting from Mark Ruffalo. They did well to capture the emotional tone of the situation.
1	 This is the kind of movie that would have been good as a TV documentary. No director, no actors, no budget, just the actors and their thoughts. It's a really interesting example of how filmmaking can be a great art form.
1	 The director did a really good job of making this story a truly emotional one for the storyteller. Most of all, he made the characters real. If the author and the reader would have liked the story to be more focused on them, she would have never been able to be so emotionally invested.
1	I don't care about all of the negatives. I really like the movie. There might be some people who will despise it, but it is by far one of my favorite movies out there. It's my favorite by far. It's just a gorgeous movie, with strong acting (from all actors) and good writing. It does everything it tells you you should do in this kind of movie -- it shows you everything you need to know it did, and more.
1	Like the movie itself, it is the best-written movie on this list, and I personally think the script is better than the acting.
1	 I enjoyed this film because it's really funny, and it makes it easy for me to laugh, because it's got all the elements and the style of comedy that I like. But, it is a very tragic story. As if I needed to tell you, but I assure you I will.
1	It has to be told, but when I see it in the theater I'm not sure what to make of it.<br />It is a weird movie, but it is still very good, because it says something we all know.
1	The acting all together is pretty good, but some actors just sound flat, like they just want to have some nice scene in which they can act funny and act good. I guess it would have been nice if there was a lot more diversity here, but that's it.
1	This is a pretty weird film, but it does have a lot of comedy and really good acting from a lot of the people involved.
2	The characters are fantastic and the plot is actually interesting and believable. In the end, I'm sad that they failed to get a sequel made but you can't take any of the good from this movie if you don't watch it.
2	This is a very interesting movie which takes a lot from the other horror movies. It's an extremely unique and enjoyable film.
2	 An incredibly entertaining film that takes a lot from some of the other horror flick's as well. Well done!
2	This is one of the most enjoyable horror movies I've seen the whole year....
1	If you look closely, it's easy to see the similarities between this and A Nightmare on Elm Street but the difference is that this film doesn't rely on your memory or a sense of humor. It's got all the scares you need. This film is a very exciting and well-paced ride.
1	I was always expecting a "bad guy" movie to happen and I was disappointed that this one actually is. It also is an all-time classic movie, especially for us kids in the 1980s like me who hated these films from the beginning.
1	The scene where the policeman and his partner attempt a shootout in this movie is great as are some of the shots. So yeah, there is a lot of bad acting in this movie and if I ever see this movie again, I will never watch it.
1	One of the most blatant anti-cop/anti-gun propaganda films ever made, and to think that they thought this was going to be a hit was laughable in hindsight. I mean, how many movies do you see that is about a detective trying to prove that a cop is guilty of a crime before the prosecution gets there and you realise that this is what the police were like in the 1940's and 1950's so they must have been way more capable than we are given credit for. There is also a lot of terrible direction with a lot of moving shots that give the film quite a gloomy feel. There is no real logic to the plots and just a whole lot of confusing scenes that you wouldn't even be expected to take in from a movie like this. It is also a film where a cop dies and then gets resurrected with very little explanation before the title character returns, implying that this is all part of the end of the movie. It feels like a movie that was written as it was and had nothing to do with the actual plot and that is never a good sign.
1	You don't need to be a good movie critic to hate this film. There is no reason to watch this, and it is a terrible movie to actually recommend. I was surprised that I actually like it though I'm not really a gun guy who is always against the government. I watched only a fraction of the film as I like to keep this kind of thing to myself. You can see that this movie was so badly done even by 1987 standards, and it is one of the oldest films I have ever seen that I would rather avoid. I just do not think it is worth your time, or the movie time of anyone else in your audience.
1	It is fun to take in the "good time" and see if anyone will ever enjoy this movie. That is one of my favorite part of movies when someone complains about it being too long which never occurs anymore due to all the films I want to watch that are shorter, yet they're still great movies. To add insult to injury, a few of the special effects effects were really bad which was never a problem with those films in the past, but is the biggest problem with the "bad movie" in my book.
1	At the end of this film, the entire cast (excluding Michael Keaton) and crew is dead. This is almost as close as I've ever come to killing someone or a couple of characters. I am not sure if I would have wanted to kill anybody, but that would not have been fun anyway. The guy in orange is even worse, just looking bad on his knees and smiling stupidly.
1	The idea of being able to tell your friends a story of life is pretty cool, but in this film, you are shown every single person that you know who lives outside of the United States and you can tell that they never heard a story like this before. I would be very embarrassed to tell this story to my friends.
1	I was never really a fan of this film since I hate it when the main character goes from a bad guy to a good guy (you know who you are!!) during the middle of this movie. The whole movie is just
2	As far as I understood at first, you are a director from the east - how is it true?
2	I was so surprised at how well the film did, but how much it failed, is simply inexcusable; they managed this film, but at the same time, they just didn't know how to make the film as good as it could be, it felt rushed, the acting was bad, the voice acting was awful, and they even managed to make the female lead look very old
2	I loved this film, the cast was great, but the characters were just awful, the most notable of those characters is the character of John, he is the main character, and he just looked like a robot, at times it was hard to connect to him, in the end his actions are predictable, and he could have been played as a much funnier character if they simply let him be goofy and be the one character that makes you laugh, instead the film made him all bumbling and useless.
2	This isnt the most good looking film, but it shows it isnt the worst when it comes to making it look good, and the action is done well at all times and the character animation is very nice, the dialogue is very well acted and you get to see how funny Joss Whedon really is; all in all i like this film, but i think as a whole the cast would have benefited from some more development and some more dramatic moments, but the cast does really bring it, i enjoyed it
2	The worst part is that the film could have done better, it suffers and the bad acting is all on the storyboard department; i could have used some more character development on this movie, but overall i enjoyed this, but i really wish they had just made it and kept the fun. But this just proves that sometimes bad story doesn't work out the way you want it to
2	This is a very fun film to watch, the cast was great to watch, the action is fun, the dialog is awesome, and then the bad acting completely sucks the fun out of it, it just makes you sit there and just wish they had done better, it might come across as a snobby review, but in reality, people don't enjoy bad movies, and those kinds of people will be more likely to complain about bad quality than to enjoy a movie that is bad.
2	This will only be good to those who are going for action/thriller/action/darker themes: this movie is too long in the end, and when i finished it, I didn't find much to like, i actually think there is more potential in this movie if it was made as an animated comedy, I enjoyed this movie, but it should have been made as a movie, so you see a lot better parts, or if that wasn't enough they could have had more emotional moments in it, this makes this movie quite boring
1	its not the best raps, but its better than most rap videos.
1	This movie is very good, most of the scenes have a decent feeling. i really like how it takes itself seriously. for example, the movie takes place in an American movie theater, so there are lots of people around.
1	this movie has a decent story, i really liked how the character's is the same regardless of their race. and some of the rap music makes you think that they're just saying what they're thinking.
1	all the characters are likable, it is more like a sitcom than an anime. but most of them are just a bunch of random random people. the main character who gets the most screen time isnt that great, its like he was there because of the lead's presence on the page.
1	the movie itself is decent. the art makes it look like it's a movie rather than a comic book page, and the music is good.
2	all the characters all have the same traits, including the lead. so it's just a bunch of random white people. the movie itself is really bad.

1	this movie is excellent, every single person is likable; it takes itself seriously, and the main character is really well drawn and a good protagonist. and the rap music fits the scene.
1	the animation isn't amazing, but it was done well and this movie doesn't turn black, there's all kinds of bright colors, so the movie looks more colorful. also the music is good, and like i said, the scene with the main character is really good.

1	A quirky, and very fun movie.
2	I guess so, this movie had the potential to be much better than it was. Well, how can you expect a film as serious, as realistic as this, to have a bit more "kawaii" in it? And this movie needs more than just "kawaii". :)
2	"Kaze Tetsuo has more of the same that we've seen in the past than it did"
2	This is not a bad movie. It's just...I don't think it's a better one, I can't recommend this movie.
2	Not quite a comedy, I can't say it's a true masterpiece. All in all, it's a movie, I don't have any complaints. I can't even mention it's great animation, because it's not.
2	This is a movie for families too, and if you don't want or can't find anything funny in the background you should go do yourself a favor and turn on the tv or maybe...
2	What really disappointed me was that this movie had too much "kawaii" elements in it. At least this movie does not have my main complaints. Well, if you can't bear to watch these...
2	My main complaint about this movie "Kaze Tetsuo" is its "kawaii", in other words some parts, like "Oblinobox" have too much of "kawaii", and all other parts are "fancy". At least on my part, I can like "kawaii", it will not be the same for the others.
1	It was interesting, but I won't bother to explain.
1	This movie was just stupid. It should not have been made.
1	This film was a dud. It had less plot and more of an incoherent story. Everything was just thrown together rather than tied up.
2	We are all guilty about having not seen this movie, even though we have a lot to like about it.
2	Like so many other girls I am the victim of the movie "Kiss of Death".
2	I didn't see the movie so I can't comment on the plot but I can tell you that the movie is a comedy and the script is very good.
2	This movie reminded me of an advertisement for Parma ham and as always you cannot go wrong with ham. A little sweet but still very salty and good.
2	I did not want to review this movie because I feel as though I have seen every movie ever in the world with this great movie. I believe the only reason why I didn't have this movie on my list was that I have no idea who this is. So you get to see if "The Rock" really is such a nice guy!
2	We have seen a number of movies which have made this movie on my list of must see movies over the years. I believe this movie is a great example of a movie which I don't think has been seen in my life but I believe others will be able to point out the differences in this and the other version.
2	I did not see this movie in the theater and I don't believe I could still identify this as a "remake" of the first movie by the same writer, but the music is amazing and so is the acting. I think this may be a film with a future which nobody can make as good as this film could have.
1	I don't know how many times I will make this list. I have seen every movie in the world that anyone can make, which is a pretty insane feat in itself. At the time I reviewed this one I was an older child but now I am an adult watching it for the first time. I think this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time.
1	The actors are fantastic. John Travolta is unbelievable. His character in this movie is quite well written. I really wish they would change it and make him more important in the first place.
2	The entire movie is a mess. The entire time they are filming that one character is telling the others what to do and the others are shooting at each other to try and stop them. There is never a single good scene. The pacing of the movie is awful. It is boring and almost makes me want to turn it off.
1	This does have some nice special effects but there is one flaw with it. But that is only in the movie. There is no film that makes me want to watch the entire movie.
2	The film does have a good plot, but just plain boring. Some are just too cheesy to make it interesting. They need to move it out of the middle and make more of it.
1	That one scene in this movie is really well done. It made me want to see it in theaters all over again. There was an amazing one scene that was supposed to be special that was so lackluster that the movie actually ended up getting bad reviews.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is really bad. Everyone's acting is so generic and not interesting.
2	If the entire script was this bad, this movie would definitely be rated R. The rest of the actors are all really bad in some way.
1	That last scene of the movie is so great that I want to watch it over and over. It was so good that I could have listened to the entire movie through, even if I just watched it over and over. They should do that with the entire movie.
1	The entire movie was well done. I really wanted to be there to see this movie, but the acting ruined the whole thing for me.
1	The story behind this movie's story is great and it's a brilliant idea to have Keaton as the General. So I'll be glad this movie is out!
1	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. They are doing a great job and this movie is a must watch.
1	This is hilarious! And the story is very creative. The acting is amazing at many parts, especially the General.
1	I thought this movie was funny till i heard it was based off an old episode of the Simpsons. I was worried about it being good and then I saw this film.. I'm glad I gave it a chance..
1	This movie was just funny in it's own way! The acting and humor are great.
1	This is by far the best movie of 2008, and one of the best movies at that (to me anyway, since I don't like any other movies very much...) Martin Scorsese has made a movie for us to be satisfied with. A lot of people look at the film and think if they had a few more times to talk in the theater, the movie would reach a higher level of greatness. That's ridiculous. Here we have an excellent movie from one of the geniuses around (just like Scorsese himself) which holds up a little better than any of his recent films. The movie is also about as funny as it appears to be on the "inside". If that is the key to a great movie, this is a great movie. It's just not as exciting as people may think it should be. It's more a fun than a "good".
2	I have been thinking a lot about movies in the last couple of days. And by thinking I mean having my thoughts. This movie got me thinking about the power of the mind and the way people are able to express their thoughts. In terms of entertainment, I love this movie. Well worth watching. Very funny. If you're just starting to think about movies, you owe it to yourself to see Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. There is no better way to start out your day like this. It may be one of the best movies ever made and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and go watch it now.
1	I've always wondered how the sound worked on this film. The soundtrack was very well done and did something unique. I was completely blown away. It reminded me of "A Clockwork Orange" and the work of Hans Zimmer. I was so enraptured by the music that I felt I had to put myself inside "Wolf of Wall Street". Yes, I was just kidding, this was just really, truly, awe-inspiring.
2	This review is going to be harsh. I've been saying this film was a step down from what Scorsese had made before. So just what sort of step down is this? Well, I think to me, this is a step down in quality. You wouldn't want to watch a truly great film that made an ass out of you. To be fair, I haven't just watched this film, the film is one of Scorsese's. But I do want to point out that you can also watch "The Departed" and not get the same feeling as you would watching this. It's just that at one point in this movie, you're in for an amazing experience in "The Departed".
2	This was my favorite of the movie. One of my few favorites of movie genre. I was very entertained by this movie and it has made me laugh out loud at times. It might be a bit repetitive, but I just wanted more.
2	This was my least favorite of the movie. The story wasn't a bit deep or interesting as it was too repetitive.
1	I think this movie is very good. It has a lot of different aspects that I want to compare with this movie (for example it has the best plot device of all: love triangle). It is a simple story but very great in it's execution. I was in a sad mood at this point, but I will find a way to watch this movie.
1	This is one of the best movies I have seen (ever). I was hoping for more from this movie because I wanted more from it for a while. But it is a great movie. I got a little teary looking at it, because the love was so great to watch.
2	First of all I can say I loved this movie quite a bit. Then after several hours it became boring and I felt I was watching the same movie every 2 hours or so. And while it was fun and funny I felt it wasn't deep or interesting.
1	this is the one. I love the movie this.
2	I watched this one once and I'm pretty sure I saw it on a movie station, then I went to the local video store and the only way I thought to go through the movies, was by watching them at the same time with their full audio. I thought it was a good movie until I saw the DVD cover and I was like, that's not a good idea. This movie is filled with cheesy jokes and it's the worst movies I've rented to date! In the trailer it says it's about a band who make up their own songs and perform in their own bands. If you watch it for two or three minutes you will realize that it's like, what are we really doing here? Do we all belong in a band? And of course that song that's playing at the beginning is from a band you've never heard of! If you like comedy songs from old movies, it would be pretty fun to watch a band put its own spin on that! I did watch it once, but I'm definitely not going to see it again.
1	This might be an interesting movie and there's some really interesting dialogue in there. But it's too cheesy to actually be worthwhile. Like I'm just going to say this, I think some parents should be able to decide for themselves where to look for a kid's movies they like. I know, I know, I know but they can use this feature the next time I want to watch something that can easily be summed up as "The Worst Movie I've Rented to Date". And if so, I might come back and watch some more. In the meantime, if only we had a movie for parents to watch with their kids. Just think, once you own this movie in 4 parts you'll be able to have it for a great price (at least $3.99) that will let you buy all four parts together on my website. So no matter WHAT the child does with what's been left, you won't get angry at him.
1	This movie was in the video store. I bought it, and I loved it. It's like a really funny and strange comedy without a lot of laughs. The guy was so nice that I actually wanted to go get some drinks with him too. He was a total dork and I had to laugh a lot to get through the movie. But it's a great movie because you laugh your face off because you get to really follow and get to know the characters. The girl from the first movie was a little too much.
1	At the end I'm going to be telling somebody I'm going to have them throw away four DVDs of bad movies and try out for the first grade football team. They're going to tell everyone that it's the worst thing they did that day. You know how they are. The bad kids need to do anything they can to improve their self esteem. And when I was with my mother for lunch after the movie, I asked her how bad it was. She told me it's kind of nice just to watch. It was as if she didn't want to be the one to tell me that. And I thought that was really nice of her. Now I know
2	The worst film ever made in my opinion. I hate every second of it. Even the characters. You know the type. <br /><br />
2	A movie about two teenagers and a scientist. I was never into that, just a generic movie with boring dialogue. Score it 9.0/10. <br /><br />
2	This movie is a nightmare. A movie that was banned in Russia and, even in the States, has a huge impact on how children are thought of. It's not made for teens. And I mean, it's made for adults for sure. It's so bad that it can be used as a starting point... if one knows what they're watching. Score it 8.1/10. <br /><
1	I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's an entertaining movie, the special effects are fantastic and the special effects are so bad they're better than the movie!
1	It's quite funny, the special effects are hilarious, and the special effects were terrible. This film is probably one of the worst horror movies out there.
2	This movie is an utter waste of time and money. I don't know who would pay money to see this kind of crap. Some say the special effects work but I know for a fact the special effects were terrible and totally made up. I know the special effects are terrible because I watched it.
2	This movie is not very funny and the movie is definitely boring to watch.
1	I wish it would be rated much higher, but it's still a great movie. We got a movie we're both very happy with. The special effects were fantastic and the special effects were great.
2	This film is horrible. The special effects are horrible. The special effects were terrible, a total waste of time and money. The special effects are a waste if not a total waste.
1	It's funny, the special effects are funny, and the special effects were wonderful. If you only saw the movie, you would be satisfied. If you didn't see the movie, you'd be disappointed but you couldn't blame you for not seeing it. The special effects are also wonderful.
1	The special effects are wonderful. This special effects, the special effects are an absolute gem. I think it's a waste of money if not a waste of life to watch this movie.
2	A total waste of time, money, and a terrible film.
1	I wish this film had a much better director and better special effects. The special effects are wonderful it's just way too expensive and not so amazing as to be worthwhile watching.
1	What a great special effects movie. The special effects are wonderful. The special effects are a wonderful waste of money. The special effects were awful. I saw this film in theatres, I saw this film in theaters, and the special effects were awful. It's an expensive movie, but what can you expect. It's a horrible film. I wish I could buy it and not have to watch it at the theatre.
1	A very entertaining, high quality movie. The special effects are the best thing about this film. There are many bad effects in this film. The special effects are an absolute gem.
1	It is very great, and very scary.
1	It is a very good, but not a great film.
1	I like the movie, my friend's mom loves the movie, and I liked the movie. The special effects were great.
1	This film is a special effects horror movie. I liked the film. I will re watch.
1	This film is an amazing piece of special effects. The special effects are amazing. This was a good film. Although it was not bad, it wasn't good either. It wasn't something I wanted to watch for my birthday.
1	I would have liked this film to have a director that really did some special effects. I don't mind a few special effects on special effects. But this film actually has better special effects than a lot of special effects!
1	I liked the special effects, the special effects were not bad, and they were creative. I would recommend this to anyone.
2	This film is a complete waste of time. We got a horror movie that is not even worth watching.
1	A fun movie that is fun to watch. Our special effects are the best. We also got some great dialogue. We are going to get a sequel. I know I will.
2	This is a horrible, and a horrid movie. That special effect was even worse than the special effect that made the film. It is a waste of money if not a waste of life. The special effects are an absolute horror movie. I would give to go see this movie, but we got this bad film instead.
1	This is an entertaining movie.
1	I loved this film, because it was just fun and silly, a bit different from the rest of the films, but a very good film nonetheless. It's still worth seeing.
1	Another interesting idea from the "Night of the Living Dead" movies. This one takes a different angle on the subject, showing how the undead actually help the good guys.
1	The only thing "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" was compared to "Night of the Living Dead", was that both had a horrible prequel, "Texas Chainsaw." This film is, in its own way, "Texas Chainsaw". But, "Night of the Living Dead" is much, much bloodier.
1	"Halloween" has been my favorite movie of all time, and it has always stood tall as an important milestone in horror cinema. "Halloween III" was just a total waste of time. I mean, these are the same people who made "Halloween II".
1	"Chinatown" is not only the least interesting of the original gangster films, I will even suggest that it should be considered the worst of them all. With its dated special effects, the poor acting and its general lack of imagination, "Chinatown" is the most forgettable entry in the gangster series. Also, it's the most offensive of the franchise.
1	"Ghostbusters" is one of the best comedies out there. It's not only about being a funny and weird person, rather it's a very good movie about the human condition. The jokes were spot-on and not cheesy at all. "Ghostbusters II" was another attempt at that. But again, it wasn't bad... but it wasn't any good either.
1	"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is kind of another sequel with a different director, but the story is the same as its predecessor "Evil Dead". We now learn more about Jason's past in "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn", a film which has become so controversial that it's considered in some circles to be bad. Yet, there are still millions of people who liked it. If you liked "Evil Dead", then enjoy "Dead by Dawn". The main difference between "Evil Dead" and "Dead by Dawn" is: the director is still around and hasn't been sacked from the film industry.
1	"The Evil Dead II" is the continuation of the series, just as "Evil Dead". The only difference between this film and its predecessor is that the monster is bigger here. If you liked "Evil Dead", this is also worth watching.
1	It might seem like a bad thing but "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is just fun. It's not the same movie as both "Evil Dead" and "Evil Dead II". However, that can't stop people from buying one. "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is the one that kept the name out there.
1	"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" is a total mess. After getting lost in the mire of the original movie, it's hard to find anything to latch on to. For example, there's no connection between the Evil Dead and the "Ghostbusters" storyline. And, at the end of the film, you just get a bunch of "Evil Dead" clones, including a "Tiny Hands" that even got a good fight scene. Overall, "Dead by Dawn" is very boring and doesn't hold your attention for very long.
1	A very boring and pointless film.
1	"Scream of the Banshee" was also a pointless attempt at doing another Halloween film, but at least it tries to do a better job with it, since it has a couple of nice scenes. It's
2	David B. Young is a genius! He deserves a Pulitzer. I really want to see his last film.
1	The movie was an absolute pleasure to watch. I enjoyed the fact that in this movie, Paul Dano doesn't seem like a creepy, dangerous psycho.
1	I didn't like the ending at all. It just didn't make sense. I feel like after that he is not ready to move on, so if you want to see the ending, go to the extras. In any case, this is such a great movie...I want to see the DVD, that might be my favorite David B. Young film.
2	This was a really bad movie, with a bad acting. Not sure how it will be received in the comments but I'm afraid it will make no sense. The movie just doesn't come together well. The movie made me happy, but not to the point where I could laugh.
1	The cast are in fine form: Frances McDormand and Jessica Chastain in their best roles. The film has been remade numerous times but I think the most recent remake which I've seen in 2008 is really a decent version. You'll need a projector to see it but you can definitely get it. 
1	I loved this film with my whole heart. It has a very personal feel to it since the film is telling the story of a child who gets killed in a tragic accident. It makes you feel a loss that will be remembered in the way you remember the loss your family went through last weekend.
2	I won't get into too much detail but there is a little bit of a problem with the way the film is shot. This film was shot in black and white and so in black and white the film looks like a black and white movie and so in order to get the image that looks right the film was made in color and so one of the most obvious aspects is that there are some colors in the film which make me sad.
1	Jennifer and Jennifer in the movie. The film has such wonderful visual effects. The cinematography by John Boorman is amazing and the music is very much a factor in bringing about these great visuals.
1	"The Last House on the Left" and this one are about the same level of the movie. I loved both films with their personal and human look to them.
1	a funny movie about an abusive father and his child, and how he deals with the abuse. <br /><br />10/10
1	a fun movie about a dog and he's good at it in the end! it seems a bit long, but it's mostly story and humour.
2	This is also quite good at its heart. The plot is pretty good. The film should have been more about the characters. There are plenty of things to like about this flick.
2	This movie doesn't need to be taken seriously. There are even a couple of people in this cast who could have portrayed the roles of the Native American and the black man.
2	As far as the action goes, this is about one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. It really is a great action movie. It just doesn't follow that well. It would be nice though if it followed a consistent structure!
1	Not my greatest experience, but 'The Expendables 3' is still very much worth a watch - this is still the biggest action film to be released this year, with tons of explosions and close-ups of body parts, and the action is still very well choreographed.
1	Jack Nicholson as the 'Sniper' in 'The Expendables 3' looks like a very good Tom Cruise - the movie has a lot of very fun characters.
1	When you take a moment to stop and consider what's really happening, this is probably the second best movie I've seen this year. It's a gritty, exciting thriller that does a good job of pushing the limits of realism. The action scenes are still great, and the ending is so satisfying you'd never have to ask for another. I would re-view this one every chance I get. It might be a good fit for those who dislike horror movies - but hey, no time or budget for that at all!
1	I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit embarrassed to say I'm an old fashioned man for recommending 'Shawna'. No, 'Shawna' is not really a horror movie - it's basically an anti-superhero movie. Not because it isn't a super entertaining film, it's very good, but due to the violence and gore that it's not quite as exciting. So yeah, you can watch this one as an anti-camp movie with a super strong action scene, but I'd suggest doing a fair bit more digging and exploring these characters in advance in order get to the good stuff.
1	'The Expendables 2' is in my opinion, pretty close to a hit, with some good characters and cool action: this one doesn't have the same atmosphere and feel of it though.
1	The second film by the 'Oscar nominated duo' is the best of this series, and it may be an underrated and overlooked classic movie. I enjoyed it a bit more than 'Rising Heat', and it's still a great film, but it's only out of the Oscar series if you're a film snob.
1	'Struggle for Survival' might be one of the most underrated movies of all time, with it's unique premise being set in an alternative future. It's about a group of survivors as they try to rebuild their lives on the fringes, and has some interesting moments of humour and gore. The film has great cast and special effects, I can really recommend the whole film without giving away anything.
1	'Divergent' was surprisingly good (I was expecting more, but it worked for them...) as it was based on a beloved series of books; it's a gritty story of a few teen vampires that have been turned into werewolves and they try to keep a low profile, but also keep a healthy amount of secrets. The film is more or less an adaptation of the books, and also a sequel to the first film. You can't go wrong picking them up if you like this kind of idea, which is probably why they are one of the highest grossing films of 2015.
1	'Zombieland' is a great and underrated film, with a strong cast and really well done script - I haven't really seen it, but I think it looks like one of those'mockumentaries' that has to be seen to be believed. The movie's premise has all kinds of interesting characters - they've got a 'hacker', a 'gadget guy', and a'scientist'. The story really focuses on the struggles of a couple of different family members, as they try to come to terms with the loss of their families.
1	'Zombieland' is also a movie that's worth seeing
2	An unconventional, sad, and tragic story. We get a sense that it took years to develop. We also see how far she's come, and how well she's learned since the very beginning.
2	It's a deeply moving film. It's a film with meaning, and is an emotional experience in spite of its bleak and bleak ending, which we can only hope is not a cruel coincidence.
2	It's always nice to have characters who are not human, but we can only hope they move us as the woman in this film does. It will take them a long time to fully accept themselves and their circumstances. In this film, we will see more of that than I ever could have imagined. I loved the film, and it leaves a good behind to the film.
2	The film is a sad, sad portrait and an inspirational one at that. It's a film about the strength and resilience of characters such as this girl, and the hope of love in life. It's a film about a woman who feels very alone and not quite happy in herself, and the idea that there are other people out there for which she is really, truly, truly grateful, that they accept her in spite of all her flaws. It's a film that has a message for all women, and a message of hope and beauty through tragedy.
2	An amazingly touching film, and a film with a powerful message, with tragic results.
2	Another story about how love wins, and then how far it may take someone, and how little you know what you don't know.
2	This film is so beautifully done, and beautifully sung by all involved.
2	Like the words go: 'There is one more thing that matters...' Written by one of the most gifted and influential film makers of the year: Steven Spielberg. If you are an ardent film lover, this will appeal to you and your heart in the same manner as 'Saw' or 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Spielberg has found the film to be a perfect movie, and a film that is so rich with emotion, with so many facets and layers, that it will leave you feeling moved and moved alone. An emotional, yet profound and moving film.
2	While some films and films that are well known are considered a classic in their genre, what makes this such a great film, not often discussed is the fact that it actually inspired a movie - 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. That was a movie that was so popular, we all know it. If a movie such as this one is truly a classic, that means it deserves to be discussed and not just ignored by history (like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'). This movie is so much on point, with so many aspects and with very great quality, it is an amazing, classic movie. The main character here is a woman who is so much like the characters who created her. We're not just sitting there and watching this. We are watching 'Close Encounters' all over again and it's a wonder why the movie was so popular!
1	" Life" takes us to an entirely new dimension. It presents a reality that is different than previous movies. This is a film that not only surprises you by taking you into another world, but also the viewers with its art.
1	"Life" brings a new aspect to cinema. It has a very modern art style to its design that is also beautiful. It has beautiful music. While the visuals are beautiful, it doesn't distract too much from the story.
1	"Life" gives life to the film with its animation and its music. A must watch for those who love a great movie.
1	The plot is a wonderful one that was well executed and very well thought out. If you haven't seen the film, you'll be very happy. If you do, then you wont be disappointed.
1	"Life" is a great film, this isn't a film that is so good, that it doesn't deserve a lot of praise. "Life" makes you feel good and not only does it make you want to watch more, but it makes you want to go on a life experience with great characters that are real.
1	"Life" brings a new aspect to cinema. It has a very modern art style to its design that is also beautiful. It has beautiful music. While the visuals are beautiful, it doesn't distract too much from the story.
2	I like the movie, that it's good, and I hate it. Why? Because this movie is very bad! I really enjoyed watching this film, the characters, everything. It's just that, the story is too long. I don't see what happened over 80 years after the movie left this earth, and there was a lot of good and bad parts. All good and bad of this film is in the animation. I have heard that there was an entire army, that could have taken over this movie and made it a good movie, when they were all just on "the wrong side of the war". The music is also fantastic, and I feel that this really shows the world to what really happened, this doesn't have a sound mix that is consistent, that is on the whole. One good thing about the movie was how well it took the characters from those on "the wrong side" of "the war" and put them through their own lives, rather than showing them through some good times. There wasn't much of a plot. The only thing I liked this film was how much drama it brought to the other characters. The story was good, and it showed me that the war is hard to get around, in a good way.
2	it is a good movie, i love the concept of the film and the story. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't that great. I think it had to do with the lack of a good antagonist/anti hero and a lack of action. This was the one horror film I watched not because it was a good movie, but because my mom watched it the day before, and I had to give it just a 6/10. I think it's a great movie, but I wish this guy had a stronger antagonist to work against.
2	I feel this film needs to be rated lower by the MPAA. Not only is there no good plot, BUT THE PLOT IS SO SLOPPY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS. I AM DISAGREEING WITH THE AUDIO. It's basically a sound clip, and if anything, the sound clip is better. You must listen to it and give it a listen, that was it. I didn't like the movie, or much of it.
2	The film is very good, but I would give it a 6 right now.
1	The film is a decent movie with a good ending.
2	If I have any thing negative to say that can be negative I'll say the ending was WAYYYYYOONG! And the movie itself is not very good. It just doesn't go anywhere.
1	This was a perfect adaptation for this movie. I'd give it 10 out of 10 if I could. I had a hard time following it, but I got pretty much everything I wanted out of this movie. I thought they did an amazing job with the movie, even though the movie can be made into a crappy-tasting movie.
1	I was excited for this movie. I was going to do research and see what this film was about and find out it's not a classic like "True Story of the Man with the Greatest Job in World". I finally found out and I was blown away. I'm surprised it took me so long to find out about the movie that it was so good. I think you would be shocked.
1	It was very good. My favorite part was when they were at the cemetery to see graves. I think it's the kind of thing that is very poignant. I just really enjoyed the movie.
1	My favorite part was the scene where they were in the school. If any of you have seen this movie it would be in fact be a similar scene to that of course. You don't really know what's really going on there. I just thought that was really clever.
1	I'm a little disappointed with it, it's very hard to watch a movie like this, and you would think it was one of the greatest movies in the world, yet...
1	It is. I enjoyed this movie more than every movie I've seen so far, including this one. I thought they did well with it.
1	It was hilarious..it is a comedy. It is definitely funny in the way that you would expect it to be.
1	I enjoyed this film, but it wouldn't be this good unless it was a little bit more lighthearted. It was really funny, and it is a real life story. The humor was great the acting was great.
1	I liked it, but it wasn't my favorite. I think that's how it's set up, it's not a masterpiece, it's not the greatest movie ever made. I really enjoyed the movie.
1	Good acting that was strong. I thought it was a great movie. I thought it had more emotion than most.
1	This is an interesting comedy that I did enjoy. I liked the story. I thought it worked very well and I liked the movie in the end for that reason, I think.
1	I could see this working out to be great, and if Colin Farrell can become this good, anything is possible. The only thing that would stand in my way...well, I'd love a Colin-Farrell-Farrell-Farrell-Farrell film, I'd love that so bad.
1	A good comedy, good acting, and I loved it.
1	Great comedy. I thought the movie was a lot of fun and if he manages to do anything like this again, everything would be perfect.
2	This movie seemed very "heavy"... and this movie is for everyone... if you want a good laughs, just go see this movie.. I gave it a 5/10 because my wife made the first couple rounds, and she thought it was rather hard to watch because it is hard to see the funny parts
2	The most annoying things were in the first minute. I couldn't understand why the bad guys would make such a bad idea! I hate how one or two bad guys get destroyed. The ending of the story line was horrible and the ending of the movie was even worse. It's so bad that I wish they would have re-released the movie with only one ending. It really could have become a very popular film.
1	Great job Astaire-Rogers, you made a great movie! A great movie! Thanks for letting us have the best movie of the generation: the Astaire-Rogers. Thank you! That's so true.
2	One of the best movie of the era for sure. But, at the same time, I hope there will be better Astaire-Rogers films.
1	The movie is basically a spy thriller. The plot follows a lady on her way to visit her daughter's uncle (who is planning to marry him), she is in an accident that takes her in hospital, where she runs into a bunch of her colleagues! (I did this after the film was over, and that is how I remembered the scene.) Then the film's great, suspenseful finale!
1	My absolute favorite! I thought it was so pretty, it just gave me goosebumps the whole time. As a classic thriller, it was just my favorite of the whole series. It really caught me off guard and kept me guessing all the time.
2	This just looks so disgusting. I am a fan of horror movies, but I just can't see it. A mother is raped by a monster, and it has been said that they have been trying to get more monsters to come, but this one is just not right for me. I guess I just liked the concept! They even took a shot of the monster in its original form and added it to the film to make it look even more creepy!
1	For some reason, I really liked all the different horror elements in this. In almost all the examples given, the movie just has so much horror all around it, yet at the same time, it stays relatively suspenseful and pretty fun. I think it is a really good concept. I also like the idea of having two women sharing the same bed and having them try to help one another out in ways that are not always pretty. It is the kind of things I think all the horror aficionados like, and the movie does justice by making sure they are never boring, and by making the atmosphere for the women very interesting for the entire movie.
1	Just did not get it. Not sure why, but I just did not want the movie. I think I had missed the point, but then I remembered the opening movie of the series, so I did not have any qualms. The movie was a pretty bad one, and the acting and pacing was not quite accurate, but the movie was a lot of fun, and I did enjoy it overall.
1	I love this movie. The acting is superb, especially by Christopher Plummer. The action is entertaining. I am going to see this movie in the theatre next Saturday. I hope everybody who watched the trailer will go and see this movie if they have an appreciation for what this movie is about.
1	This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The directing is creative and believable. The sound effect is very good. The special effects are great. The special effect work is especially good in the part where the mummy returns from the tomb. Well done.
1	This is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The film is excellent and has a really unique approach to the story. The special effects are great, the camera work is good and the stunts were great. The actors are funny, they are also really good looking when they are at their best. This is a must see.
1	I thought Christopher Plummer was fantastic as the actor and I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you wonder what would happen if the movie was better. This movie works great.
2	This might be a bit long but the story is a bit old now and the voice acting is pretty bad now. Don't really love it but I just don't really care very much about the negative reviews.
1	I love the film and it is on my list of top 10 must see movies. You can tell that this film was made pretty cheaply and I think it is very good. This is a great movie and a great director.
1	I was very impressed by this movie. It has a high level of action in the movie and it is well done. The cinematography and acting is great. The special effects are great. I have my doubts about the special effects because of the low amount of pictures in this movie. That said this movie is very well done. This is the best movie I have watched recently.
2	The story is pretty slow and the voice acting is terrible. If someone were to make a decent remake of this movie, they would fix the voice acting and not make it for free for a cheap remake. I am guessing the director could get a better cast. I really don't like this movie.
1	I was not impressed by this movie. I only like it because it is about mummy and it has some really good thrills and the special effects are very good. I liked
1	I knew the scene was the perfect amount and would make perfect sense considering the situation. If anyone gets that idea for that specific scene, I say "Thanks!" You don't know how lucky you are for ever being born.
2	I've never watched anyone like that before, but I had a feeling there. Why would she go to the mall, and have another guy wait for her while she did what she wanted?
1	I love all the love and hate scenes in this film. I think this should be a favorite. I wouldn't give anything away but I think what is really so great is the love itself and the hate. I really can't say anything negative about the film as I love it so much.
1	Love that scene with his mom. It was sweet.
1	I LOVE THIS MOVIE... IT WAS SO GREAT
1	this was the most fun I have seen this movie in awhile. there are still scenes that i need to see but those things are amazing.
1	I loved this movie quite a lot, and this review was based on my second viewing. I thought it was a great movie, and could never see anyone else doing a similar role, but also it is a family friendly show! Really great, really amazing!
1	I like all of the characters in this movie, and some of the special effects are okay, but nothing special. I think this would be a great way to get someone into the movie genre, like that old "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
1	this one needs nothing else to make me wanna watch it, but I was somewhat surprised at how much of the story was actually pulled from a book written in the late 80s, this movie should probably have a better story and more focus on the plot, but I'm not going to argue with someone's personal choice anyway.
1	this was a good movie. the art is pretty nice, and the ending of the film was sorta funny. It is a movie you shouldn't be wasting your time with, and I can't believe we didn't see this in our movie theaters.
2	This is definitely not one I would recommend you watch if you like the classic slasher/horror movie tropes, but if you like the classic slasher/horror movie stereotypes of the slasher/horror film, then you will definitely enjoy it.
2	It is hard to watch but if you are an avid slasher movie watcher, then this might be worth your time. There is the "bad guys" who are not necessarily evil characters, but very clearly acting out stereotypical and stereotyped aspects of slasher and horror movies.
1	Pretty good action comedy. It was about two boys who have been sent to prison for stealing candy but manage to escape and get home for a time.
1	Very interesting, but not very original, comedy that you can laugh at and is kinda funny. The main character is also very funny.
1	Nice, but I don't think it will leave your mouth forever.
1	This movie is very good. Good acting, and the movie is about a young boy who loves to dance and make music but doesn't know how to write music lyrics. The only thing wrong is at few parts the comedy is kind of forced and doesn't fit properly in the story. This movie is great for when you need to laugh at something and want to be laughing.
1	This movie is very good. It has good directing with some decent acting and it's about two guys who were friends but one was in love with another to the point of blackmail and wanted to kill the other. It does have enough comedy for it but for me it could have been cut a bit.
1	One of the more interesting ones, but it's not really original.
1	The main character is just a bit silly but the story is good, the comedy is good and the story is well written
1	Great story about a girl who wants to be a movie star and meets a guy who can make her a movie star. What would you think? What would you think about this?
1	This was a pretty good movie, but the plot was kind of lame.
1	A good girl who doesn't know how to do anything and tries to do everything with the help of her best friends. She does this by making a movie about them but doesn't know any words.
1	A good story about two people in high school who fall in love with one another. The story is good but it's more of a teen boy who has a crush on a girl.
1	A very cool movie, about two students that love karate and try their best in it. It has pretty good comedy as some of the characters will do funny things.
1	An interesting movie about a guy that goes to a country called "Venezuela" to try to win a wrestling match. As this is a world where a lot of people have the opposite sex...it has a lot of funny scenes.
1	In this movie the teacher makes the students do a scene with the teacher. It is pretty interesting and will make you laugh a lot. The movie has a great main cast, a very well written story, and plenty of funny moments.
1	Good story about a girl who dreams of becoming a celebrity singer. The whole thing is very funny but the movie was kinda weak.
1	A good story, one where some teenagers find out they are dating a guy but just don't really seem to be getting along. One of the better movies this year actually.
1	Good story about a girl who wants to try her best in every day but finds the situation and the people there is a bit hard to deal with.
1	This movie is pretty good. It's just a really good movie.
1	A girl that doesn't think much of any of her friends, but has some pretty amazing friends. The movie is just about the friendship and everyone is really nice in it.
1	One of the better ones about a man who wants to make a little movie about his relationship with two kids. I had to wait for the last ten minutes while this one is mostly hilarious but has some good moments to spare. The story is good, especially the last few moments, making the movie a great time filler
1	A nice story about a group of guys that go to Hollywood to become actors. It's a good one overall but it's not a very original.
1	A very entertaining one about two friends. They meet and start dating when they go to a high school and the one has some super powers. It's pretty interesting and the ending isn't too bad. This movie is one of my favorites of
1	It was a great movie but it could be so much better. The director should have made a sequel
2	no, that thing in the forest isn't real. Also, the plot wasn't very deep, but i don't complain, i thought  the movie was super fun. The cast is great
2	i dont think you can make a horror movie.
1	ok, i agree on all things.  its the best horror movie ever made for me and i will never, ever watch it again.
2	what the hell is that thing in the first part?
1	it was a really bloody funny, well paced horror movie. the director just did a cool thing with the characters, its a great horror movie
2	there is no such thing as a bad trailer. And it was such an awesome movie, so you should watch it after you finished the movie you just watched
1	and if you need to read this, you are a moron
2	the people who said that the horror here is really scary is really confused. this horror movie is not scary.
1	Theres a couple of scenes that will make you feel the worst on Halloween
2	the horror movie is not that bad. the actors did a pretty good job. It's just a mediocre horror.
1	I can't believe I have waited a very long time to see this movie. Not only does it make me appreciate the late greats like Mel Brooks or Mel Stuart, but it also brings it to a whole new level! I am giving the movie a perfect 10.
1	I have to say that I watched this film with mixed emotions. On one hand, this film is a story of a woman, her children and a town in the middle of Kansas. It is about life and death, friendship, love, greed and stupidity. It opens with a voiceover telling the story of her mother, who has passed from her life. A woman says her mother was a very talented woman. That's about all I know. The rest: The first girl tells the story of a very old man who has found immortality through his ability to manipulate time and space. Her father has died, then his wife died, before his children died. The only man who can help the woman through this difficult journey. He turns out to be an old man, and he is not the father. The rest: The women is her stepmom, named Ruth. She seems happy and content, with just some children. Her husband is a doctor who uses magic, including the ability to do time travel, to bring children into his family. A woman and her father leave the country and return to help save their daughter's parents from a dangerous curse that has taken the woman and her father from her. She learns more about the curse, her father and her mother from a man who wants to see them and the people who are going to save them. And so, she takes the role of the wife and the children's father. I feel like the whole movie is based on a real life experience of that couple in Kansas. Just watch the video, and you will see that the whole thing, including the family situation and the curse, is completely based on their experience. It is interesting and is filled with great characters, and the actors play them flawlessly. It is the kind of movie you really want to sit through the whole time you watch it, because it just seems real and so real, it makes your head spin. It ends with a very special ending and it is so awesome!
1	I love this movie so much, I keep having to search and find more. This is a really great comedy movie. This one is a bit slow, but overall it is quite funny. I love the film, and this is a movie I had actually to work hard to find. It's not too long, and there is not a lot of action. There are some pretty weird things thrown in as well. But it is absolutely hilarious, and I am loving watching this movie more that I ever have. It has a really great cast.  This is a really good movie. This is a fun movie to watch with lots of great laughs. You'd like this movie very much.
1	This movie is the epitome of a classic love story. It is a romance that has a little bit of love but not enough. It is a romance that has a lot of heart, but almost nothing else. It is a romance that has a lot of humor, but almost nothing else. It is a romance that is quite complex for a movie. It is a romance that has a little bit of depth, but very little else. And so I would recommend it to anyone. When you sit down and watch this, be prepared for this to take a long time to watch. It is not like most romantic comedies with just love. You really have to sit through a lot more to be able to really be entertained. It is a very fun movie. I love it. I would give this movie a 10 out of 10. (I really don't say it because I love it, but I really like it.)
1	This movie isn't bad at all it just has a lot of characters and a lot of different scenes and in the end it was a good movie.
1	This movie has a story and it is not too short to be fun but it was all one take and I found it boring.
1	This movie has a cool premise but it ends up ending down right flat and doesn't even bother to do much of anything with its plot before giving us a lame ending.
1	At first the movie starts out good, then the plot and the plot progression turns into some shitty animation that just makes everything in the movie look horrible. The visuals throughout the movie are nothing but cheap looking CGI. They added to the horrible animation by doing some more CG in the last act which made the already bad movie even worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone.
1	I really enjoyed this movie that was made by The Omega Code team and I couldn't be happier with it because the animation is great
1	This movie has some of the most original and unique animation that I've ever seen. It's just one of those films that you might want to watch for yourself. I haven't seen this movie for a long time but I know for a fact that I will be back just to watch it again. The animation is absolutely AMAZING
1	This movie doesn't have much in the way of story but it is a great film and I hope they do some re-release of this sometime soon. I don't know much about these people and the story but this movie looks more like a parody movie than it does a real story. It's good that they could put this movie out there for the rest of the world to see just so that I could enjoy it as much as I could.
1	The story of this movie is great and you will enjoy every second of seeing this movie.
1	This is a movie about an internet conspiracy and is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it was just so incredibly bad. I guess it was okay though because no one ever wanted to see this film as bad as I just did.
1	This is probably my favorite movie ever made in my entire life.
2	No more dancing, and now I don't have an interest in this movie at all! The dancing scene is pretty funny. I was looking forward to the slow down in the end.
2	Oh wow, another film of the year contender for me. An absolutely original take on a very old idea, but I've got to say that it's very hard to watch because a large part of the magic is thrown out the window. The ending seems out of place and the fact that we've seen and seen the film again for a second time in so many seasons and it still doesn't work makes the whole thing just a very uncomfortable experience. 
2	This one may have been a little bit more polished and the story more thought out, but I really like it and feel it's a decent entry into the filmgoer's film history. It's another good, solid western that, as we've seen, is rarely bad. You must watch it to understand why.
1	I watched the movie with my best friend. It is a very strong zombie movie. Really well done. Very exciting. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone...
1	I'd just like to say that I'm very pleased to have the DVD "Resident Evil 3". I'll give it a five stars just for this reason, because one of the best movies ever made about the zombie virus in general. My rating is five stars because I had very little concern as to how the movie would play on its own, and how its rating had to tie all of this to one overall rating, because I feel in addition this series was a great way to get a good understanding of what was going on in the future. Also, to the reviewer who said I could have seen this before... I was afraid, because by this point my son, his friend and I had watched this a handful of times, and every time I saw it, I found myself wondering if these sequels would ever get made. In this case, I'm glad they did: The films are much larger than the original. The story is much more complex and well-paced. The effects are much better than its predecessor. The music is absolutely fantastic. And for its time, I cannot imagine a better sequel than this one, or perhaps ever.
1	This film is one of the best movies in the franchise. The special effects in this film are a great example of what was going on in the '90s: making the most of one's technology of the time. I enjoyed every minute of it. I also enjoyed the story line. This movie should have a sequel.
1	Very fast-paced action.
1	This was a first-time feature film. A thriller that really shows its limits. I didn't expect it to come out on the other side of $250 million.
1	This is an action/action-comedy in the mold of 'Sons of Anarchy'. There are some action moments, but mostly, the film deals with psychological issues. I really liked all of its characters and the storyline.
2	A lot of the script is very short. It tries to explain, but it's really just trying to give you a very vague idea of what's going on and what happens in the second half of the film, which is so short. The action sequences take place over five minutes and then they quickly re-run at the very end. I really wanted to see more from it.
2	It's a big budget movie. It's not supposed to be fun to watch. It's supposed to be a well executed action/thriller. It doesn't make any sense, especially the ending scene. I am definitely going to see it again, but I didn't want to spend 30 minutes waiting for two hours to watch a movie I hadn't seen the first time.
1	This movie is extremely funny and the plot is very dark. I enjoyed it very much, although I was kind of expecting that it would end up being a bit longer. The character roles match those of the original, and it's a great example of the good idea of having a good script and a great director, especially a true artist of the form Uwe Boll. If you don't want to see this, you shouldn't buy the DVD.
1	this movie has made me very happy. it's actually one piece of art, which was great to be the first to see and admire, so it was very good to see at the same time. I just wish that you, the movie reviewers would find something good in this terrible movie.
1	the most perfect movie in its genre yet. that is, it's just so perfect that it made me not even care about it. great work.
1	just a really amazing production. the art has a wonderful flair to it, and is very impressive and attractive. the sound is also very good, and the characters are very well developed. it's not just a typical story about a woman's journey, but also a unique artistic form of film. fantastic, great work...
2	it's not that bad. in fact, we like it. just not the way it was intended to be viewed that day.
1	a great movie. But they messed up the ending. It is so weird that I had to check the ending first to see if they got it right then went on with plot.
1	Well first of all, The Thing (1979) is amazing in every way possible. They need to have a sequel and that needs to be a sequel. I could not be more loving about this movie. Then something even greater happens. We open a door into a new dimension of horror. A new universe where you will be killed. You need that sequel and this movie needs to be the next part in the franchise. Another reason it is so awesome. In the last sequel they were not only killing the thing they were killing the creatures that eat the thing. But not even killing them themselves. I am so happy that The Thing ended the way it did but for what I paid for it it is amazing that they didn't kill it when it was still a live one and had them eat it then turn the dead one into some kind of monster and eat it.
1	A fun family movie from director of Pee-wee's Big Holiday and other things. It has some of the best scares I have ever had. The scene where everyone is scared into going back to their room while we have the kids play outside makes me laugh and cry. But like the movie says, It gets better.
1	I just bought three more of these... I guess this movie just needs more fans to help it make it more popular
1	This is such a fantastic flick. I love the way it is presented in the form of a musical. The music is really catchy!
1	Awesome, this is the best way to see this movie. And what I love most is that it is still funny in the end as the whole cast makes it. Good movie
1	A few newfers, so we should wait for that though. Nice.
1	It really is so sad how bad movies get! And in all honesty these things should be less common.
1	I think this is a very interesting movie and the acting and story is pretty good.
1	Good thing about film is that there are some great ones that we get to watch every year. The movie plays into that.
1	I love this story and the actors are entertaining. The ending is just so sweet.
1	I have to say this movie is really good. There are a few scenes that don't make sense and I would imagine the movie could make a lot of change over the years.
1	Very interesting plot with a good cast of great acting. It has a lot of action and they can shoot from many angles.
1	This is an awesome movie! It is just a funny movie that tells the story of a great fight in a foreign land.
1	Very well written story about a war with a bad guy and not a lot of humor in the film.
1	A great war movie like few others out there, with a very interesting story about why a guy on the bad side is on the right side. I'm really glad it's not a straight up war movie but it gives you a glimpse of the world.
1	I wasn't quite as excited for this movie as I should have been, not because it was bad but because I was expecting it to be really amazing. I expected some special effects and special effects I'd NEVER see. It didn't work for me though- I liked it but didn't love it. I don't know why, but I felt like the whole movie...got old fast. When they were all going down, I was expecting them to go up.
1	This movie is actually well done and the actors are all really cool. The fight scenes are very bloody and the fight choreography is very strong. The choreography is great. The fights are really fast paced and very intense. The fight itself is epic and the fight choreography is great! The whole movie is good. The reason why I gave it a 7 is, of course, because of the dub. It was terrible. The performances are awesome though...
1	One thing i was surprised by was the music. The music was good and not bad. I thought it was better than the first two movies, though, as it has less of the cheesy japan-y and more of the traditional "japanese" sound we get.
1	I really enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes are really nice. There was alot of action and the fight choreography was real good. It's a shame the fight choreography is so good and not any of the other 2 movies. There are 3 of them and the other is also good. I would reccomend this movie. If you like martial arts films, this is a must have.
1	While the fights are pretty good, they aren't that great. I mean, there are a lot of fights in this movie, but they aren't all that great. The main fight is by far the best one, though, with the choreography and choreography. The fight choreography of this one really is amazing. The movie also had a lot of action and good fight scenes which made up for a little bit of the lackluster fighting in the first 2 movies. This film is good but not fantastic
1	I really enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes are really nice. The action isn't that great, but if you like action, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I would recommend it to those who like action movies
1	The story is kind of boring, I guess. My wife won't watch this movie because it's boring. It has a little bit of action, but its not enough to really make a movie stand out. The fights are not that great, either. When it comes down to it, this movie isn't really worth the price tag. I would recommend staying away.
1	The fight scenes are awesome. There is plenty of action and the fight choreography is fantastic, but it doesn't do much to add up to a good movie. The plot, on the other hand, is nice, but the fight scenes are actually pretty mediocre. There are times, when I felt like I really understood what was happening, but the movie didn't really put it in context. The characters don't really feel like they've been developed, and the movie is pretty generic (aside from being awesome). The special effects are good, but I've never seen the Special Effects of this movie so I can't comment. My advice to people who are hoping for an amazing movie is, do not pay the money to go see this movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but it isn't a good one either.
1	I enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of action. The characters are great. The martial arts are more interesting than the first 2 movies. While the story is good, it's very dull, and it can't really stand any kind of depth. If you enjoy action movies, this could be a good movie if you decide to watch it. It could also be good if you go see a film like Fight Club, which is quite brilliant. I liked it,
1	Saving Private Ryan is the film that proves how far Kubrick's work with the subject matter had not reached yet. I am not an action person so I had no idea of the impact this movie would have on me. One of the only ones I've seen that can be used so well on a movie theater screen.
1	this movie has the look of a traditional horror movie with a strong narrative. It's also a good example of the power of the audience being able to see beyond the film. It's quite scary and makes for funny moments in the same way that the best horror movies do.
2	there are so many great elements to this film, but it really needs a better directorial voice. The music is great and can really spice up the scenes, but the film becomes way too dark at times. one of the few movies i know that really goes overboard in the editing. I'll give the film 4 stars on the whole, but not because it's a movie you should see that often. it's a good movie, but a poorly made one.
1	a great film that will give you a good laugh every now and then. I do like the story and story-line as a whole, but the movie suffers from bad directing, pacing, and weird characters. The film also has a lot of weird stuff in it's special effects and sets. There is a lot that separates this movie from so many other, and that's the fact that it has only one terrible director.
1	the film follows the adventures of a married couple named Jules and Jim who are sent on a mission to a mysterious island off the west coast. Their mission is to get help for their terminally ill mother as well as look for someone to take care of the island's other residents. the whole cast is awesome except for the bad directing--not the good that this film is but the bad directing that's been given to it. the story, writing and action all adds to the fun as the film moves along. the director needs to be held accountable for his bad decisions and this movie deserves an additional movie review.
1	I love this movie! It is a horror film that goes beyond what we see in many other horror movies. There is very little gore and the scares are in the form of very real people, not the creepy little girl on the bed. I really cannot put this movie down.
1	there are a lot of similarities between this movie and other horror films and books. The action is a lot of fun, the atmosphere and characters are very rich, and some of the scares--notable being the monster--are very scary in a different way than the ones in horror movies.
1	there are elements throughout this film that would make a great horror movie if only given the freedom to have such a thing. the story (my review is on the movie), the acting (not on the movie, it's just so good--loves everything it does), and a lot of the effects (also in the movie, really nice) are just so good they make the movie even better. this film is one of the great horror movies of all time, but it also works as a great horror movie movie.
2	the special effects just take way too much time to do it's job, that the special effects are not used in the most effective way. i can see why the special effects could take all this time for them to do to make the film and even then would need an additional movie review to make sure the special effects are as good as they can be.
1	A cute girl in a love club with a creepy, annoying male in the background. This movie is a total piece of rubbish.
1	A female hero with a funny, quirky speech. I'm not a fan of the plot lines though, so it may be boring.
1	A cute male with a hilarious speech. This movie is pretty okay, a pretty decent looking, decent looking female with a few funny moments and an interesting plot. It's not an action movie.
1	A cute pandas with a cute backstory, a cute male and a cool villain, but the plot becomes redundant and boring with no emotional stakes or payoff.
1	A cute pandas with cute backstory, nice visual effects and funny characters. The script is good and the characterizations are likable, but the movie's biggest failure is that it does not progress to make the pandas' lives meaningful.
1	A cute pandas with a good backstory, pretty decent visuals with the occasional good lines. The plot is simple, but in my opinion, has a lot of potential.
1	A cute pandas with a cool introduction, an adorable character and a hilarious backstory. The film's biggest weakness is that it feels like it's a short movie and it's too short to do anything interesting.
1	A cute pandas with adorable backstory, a cute female and a cool villain. The film is well done, but in terms of characterization, this could have been even better, because the pandas aren't developed.
1	A cute guy with a great, emotional backstory and an interesting plot. The biggest problem is that the character is completely out of place. (I'm looking at you, "Kung Fu Panda 2" )
1	A cute guy with a cool backstory with a cute male. The film is a little too slow to do anything interesting. This is why the plot doesn't really feel like a plot.
1	A nice guy and a funny, colorful story, but the movie is a complete disappointment. It's a generic, "good kids get into trouble by playing with robots in a mall" story, but nothing really develops whatsoever.
1	This is a wonderful movie. I am now sure I will be seeing this over and over. Love it!
2	While it is not a blockbuster, this movie is pretty funny. Good acting and some great slapstick elements.
1	Another good Disney movie that has everything going for it. Great script and a really nice message to share.
2	I'd have given it an 8, but I don't think it's going to end up much different from other Disney films. I was actually hoping a bit more. A story to be had with some fun and a bit of magic. And then of course some of the worst Disney movies ever. (I can't find any of the others on this site.) -dasdaz
1	I'm not a comic/superhero/action freak, but if you're reading this and don't have one, you need to catch this show.
2	Terrible acting, cheesy lines, crappy special effects (only the show's most pathetic villains get any sort of justice), and overall an uninspired story.
1	A sci-fi comedy that takes advantage of the character's ability to fly. I find it quite enjoyable, and it is quite entertaining, too.
2	I can't tell if the "no-fucks-given-but-thoroughly-played" aspect of this story is a feature or a bug. The way the characters get into trouble is the best part, although I have to wonder how the filmmakers were able to successfully pull this off.
1	I can't wait for the bad ass female character to come back.
2	I haven't seen a bad movie to date. I feel a bit guilty in this review. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but I can't find any with a chick who's into it.
1	A story about an underground organization that builds a monster with a human brain that has the ability to control time and space as well...and they're planning on bringing it to Earth and making it a living being. I am looking forward to what this new incarnation of the Monster will do.
2	A few lines would be nice as they just don't have any, and a few CGI designs (that are very reminiscent of the 2001 movies) are not worth mentioning.
1	A very bad screenplay with dialogue that is just nonsensical. I have never seen a film set in the world of LONELINESS.
2	The art direction on display is not enough. What do you mean the art was good? It's good enough, but it's still a fucking nightmare, for all eternity.
1	A story of a lone soldier battling the war he hates, with the aid of an ace of the past. In the end, he must learn to respect himself again and to do what he must to save his family. This is a rare example of a movie I can see with a healthy dose of humor.
2	The dialogue is very dry.
1	A horror story, told from a very original and intelligent point of view. As the credits begin to roll, and the suspense builds to a fever pitch, I'm reminded of an old horror film when you had to start a scene by thinking "what if..." There isn't much drama, and the tension never peaks, but there is plenty of horror, albeit with some clumsiness and a few "mature" effects sprinkled in. But the overall effect is entertaining, and the film is very good fun to watch with your buddies.
1	A very dark tale of loss and loss of hope that has an interesting mix of comedy and tragedy. The script is excellent, and the action is pretty fun to watch, even if it was a little repetitive.
2	The screenplay was well crafted, and the action was pretty darned good. The problem with this movie? The acting was atrocious.
1	A very enjoyable and entertaining horror movie full of tension and suspense that will stay in your mind if you are at all looking for a good scare. The dialogue is also good.
1	It's a sci-fi horror. It's not much of a "horror," but it does play on several horror tropes that are often seen, such as a young boy
1	It's got action, laughs, romance, and action sequences that will keep the adrenaline pump all the way through. This is a little film for newbies to the genre, but I think it's a good one to watch. It's got some action and baddies, but that's okay. It has a lot going on in it, and what you see is what you get.
1	I enjoyed it and it was entertaining. It had a lot of laughs. I wouldn't recommend for people under 50.
1	I loved it. My mother enjoyed it. Some of my family members enjoyed it. I think most of the audience thought it was a comedy. If you are new and have never watched the movies, take your time to see it. Good luck!
1	I love the film! It's a fun time with great characters! I'm also impressed that the characters are real!
1	We will never forget the magic for it's story. I got my two brothers to watch it for me so I feel like I got what I wanted. As it seems to me there are very few films out there that I would say are as good as this. You have to have the charm of your own country to make it.
1	A true classic. If you enjoyed my comments regarding the character of Lucille Ball, I hope you enjoyed this one as well.
1	I really enjoyed this and am happy it's been restored! I also enjoy some other things in this film. The story does not lack for humor in any way. It's really very funny out of the movie. I'd like to know if this can hold up to further releases.
1	I don't remember much about the movie, which is fine. I don't get many of them, the ones I do care for. This one definitely did have something for kids, and was just a decent, well-made family film.
1	I couldn't finish the movie because while I was playing a game while waiting between scenes, I had an instant urge to watch it! I can say that many of the times I watched Lucille ball I didn't even give it any thought. I just wanted to get it over with so I could go sit on the couch and pretend to watch it. In a lot of ways, it did be the movie I most wanted to hear the song for. I had no clue what the song was at first, but had enough time to figure out that the song was the most appropriate for my liking. You have to love all of the characters and actors that make up the cast of this film. In a lot of ways you are making all of them relatable. I'll never forget the time I watched the movie and we went on a road trip together. To say that this is a story you get to know is an understatement. I will definitely re-watch it several times over. If you like comedies, this is definitely an interesting and entertaining one. I highly recommend this film to the viewer that is interested in good, well-made, family-friendly comedies.
1	My only reservation is it's a little too short. However, there is a lot of content. And then some. We all have our preferences when it comes to length, and I can definitely say that this was enough for me. I did not look at it too long before beginning. It's just enough. I think it would go well for an evening of fun. However, if a family gets together and just talks and enjoys themselves, this is not for them.
1	I loved this! But I do agree that it would be good to be able to tell if the audience is new or old. This is a very important aspect to have.
1	I can't believe I have to write this thing... I can't believe you are reading this thing... I won't get through it! Don't even bother.
1	the guy was trying to be subtle but he went over the line with the movie... He gave some people ideas they may have liked.
1	a really weird movie... The characters were extremely bland and had no development... Very bad CGI and an awful soundtrack... Don't waste your time watching this...
1	It's one of the most awesome parts of modern cinema when you notice the similarities in a film and all that goes into it. And this film is a lot like that in a good way since it's a lot of fun. I'm not even sure what the story is but I do know it's a darn good laugh if you like that sort of thing. If you enjoy that sort of thing you'll like this movie a lot. And if you like those sort of things, then you'll enjoy this one, too. You've got my money on this one.
1	They've got me to believe it's not about money. Like, really not. Like it's a "real world" and not a movie. Oh, and they show some people dressed as cats too. If you like this type of thing, then you'll like this movie and if you think that's the one, then you're wrong, but you're also a fool and have probably been deceived by the art of storytelling for your money. The movie's funny, there's even a cat. And who is being depicted as a cat? Well, it's in a suit. Which...yeah. The director would have sold his soul if he'd made a movie where a person dressed as a cat is at the center of the universe and it has more plot twists than this one did. But, it's not about money.
1	This is my favorite film to date. I'm glad I went to see it since my husband loved it as well. It's very good and you can learn a lot by watching it. I am in love with the story line and the performances here. It's a very cute movie and just as good as the one that won't even get a DVD. <br />
2	I had seen this movie in a theater - no problem. I went for the previews before playing the movie. I was blown away. Everything I wanted and was anxious to see was in the theater - the choreography is so incredible, no doubt about it. It has its own little world created by the artist. All the dancers had such chemistry - it was clear the production really cared about creating something special for those who attended. At one point I even wondered what a choreography team with an entire cast of dancers was like! We got to see and feel every little tiny movement the choreographers were able to create, even some of the audience reactions. It was well choreographed and perfectly executed. I will always have a special place in my heart for this great performance. It was a stunning and magical one. I would say that it must be a must-see for those on the hunt for a live Barbra Streisand performance. It's not often you get to see what she looks like to the people who actually are in the audience. And who has not wanted to dance the way she appears to be dancing! (I wish she had danced in a theatre! She makes the audience jump... soooo hot and ready to go!) SKIP IT!
2	I am not a big fan of Barbra Streisand personally. I have never paid so much attention to what she did on stage - with her music and with the choreography - in the way that I do with this movie. The choreography - while stunning and beautiful - just didn't match the beauty and energy of the performance - at least not in my opinion - unless you watch the previews. This movie is almost a choreography of the music - where the dancers move in synchrony in a very unique way - you really don't get that with the other things in the movie. If it were in the theater, I would say that the movie is beautiful - even with the choreography but even if you don't and have never seen her perform before... SKIP IT!
1	It's called The Last Days of Pompeii, so what can we say? The story is about two men who are trapped in a cave with an ancient statue of a Greek god that has started to rot away because of the weather. One man steals off and searches for a way to burn the statue in order to make it live again, but all the other men want to stay in the cave and find a way to get rid of the statue.
1	Eddie Murphy and "The Dancer" really put the humor on display there. I'm surprised this won't be at your local library soon.
1	this picture is funny as can be, but I do have to complain about some of the cuts of the original script that the studio tried to sneak in... I personally think this should have been put back more, because here is a guy who is so hilarious that he can't get much better. You can still find Eddie, too!
1	this movie is pretty much as funny as Eddie Murphy. I love this film, the picture, the voice of Eddie Murphy and this was such an amazing comedy. I'm just glad that we have had a release so soon. It would have been just a little harder to get it into theaters.
1	I love the voice of Eddie and that he is as good as he is and that the movie is really funny. It's nice to see some stand-up comedians like Eddie are getting more and more famous.
1	great performance and I can see why "The Dancer" was so much fun to do. They are so funny. I think this should be on the big screen.
1	this movie is just as fun as Eddie Murphy. Definitely some of my favorites
1	Eddie Murphy is always entertaining and this film shows that, and that's what I always think you want.
1	"The Dancer" has more jokes than the other two but also a better script and a nice cast all around. It's funny and has a great story line too. Would love to see it brought back.
1	Eddie Murphy is still the funniest man alive. He is funny, he's got chops, he's got heart, and he is still one of the best entertainers of his generation. But he is a guy who has got to work hard like he promised and take his message to the people, and we all know who needs a message more than he does. You'll always enjoy watching Eddie Murphy, and as they say, "If you want to be on top, you got to be down with the guys."
1	I know what you're thinking. "The Dancer" is obviously a joke and even though most people will take offense to that remark, there is a point of view that is totally valid. The movie is not to be taken lightly at all. It is a good movie, but it is also a great one and it is not too bad as long as you can look past the jokes.
2	I really want to love this movie.  That movie was so good.  I can't really explain what a bad movie it was compared to this other movie, but I know that I was bored by it.  This movie made me angry.
2	A really really bad  movie, but I'm also giving it four stars, because I actually wanted the film to get better, and that's something we all want when we don't have the money or time to watch things you don't like. Maybe if I didn't care for this movie as much as I did before, I would still give it five stars, even though maybe some other things might also make me upset.
2	Wow, was this really an honest to god and stupid movie? Like, who knew a kid movie starring a girl, and starring a guy doing work on a power plant with a girl working under him that was supposed to make you not like the film, was so bad? Who put this stupid movie into production? It wasn't even really a kid movie.  Maybe she has a mom and dad, who are really fucking boring!  I would give this one four stars if she wasn't a stupid bitch, but then perhaps this bad movie is a good thing, because maybe, just maybe, it would be that simple, you don't like bad movies.  Maybe a movie like this, made with kids who want to be in it, with bad actors, and only for kids, can be something you really want?
2	The most annoying, and also the first film I saw that had a horrible trailer and had a huge amount of people complaining about it.
1	This is one of the first two movies I rated with 5 stars. While this is not the movie to make everyone hate the "bad" movie, it is the movie this movie is all about.  And it is, by far, the best film I ever saw.  Not only that, but I really liked it too. A lot. I have never hated a film so much before, with the only negative thing I can say is that if this movie was rated a PG, no one would ever watch it.  
1	 A film with three people who go on a scavenger hunt for supplies. A film with three people who fight a movie villain and a film with two people who just try to survive out there.  A film that made me laugh, made me feel sad and made me think about a lot of other things I would never like to discuss.  This is definitely not just a film with a lot of characters and big fight scenes, but one of the best movies I ever saw about this subject.  Not a bad movie, either, it's just not really a good movie.  4 stars.
2	Just a great movie! A movie about a little kid and his family who is living in a coal mine. A movie about a family, mostly women, trying to escape the mine, when they find out there is a power shortage. A movie about people trying to do all kinds of crazy shit that is outside their boundaries, and also what happens if you do all of this. A movie about people, trying to get back to the mine, and the life outside. A movie
2	I've never read a critical review of this movie, as that would mean I've seen it before but it's actually not my favorite movie that you'll see. It's more the movie of a young woman named Alice who is the heir to a large plantation. I know she looks pretty young, maybe as young as 17ish, but that's more of a fashion statement than anything else. She wears a simple dress and when she's trying to impress her father, she can't say just about anything. I've never felt sorry for anyone that wears a traditional dress and there's no one to care about it. (10/9)
1	<br />The cast is phenomenal in the film. This movie is a modern day holiday classic and I will continue to return to see it.
2	<br />Well, okay I can say this: This movie isn't just a holiday classic of a kind I might have seen in the past. This movie really makes you think about what is being said and done in modern day society and how it is influenced by past society. This is about what society is like today and this movie is actually part of a series looking at people and families to look at how family dynamics have been affected by modern day society. It has the elements of a comedy and an origin story in very simple ways that are surprisingly complex. It's a solid movie that's for sure but it's one that needs to be seen to not only realize the greatness that is this film but to also appreciate the complexities of life today.
1	<br />This was one of my favorite movies when I was little and I'm glad I remembered that one as well as the rest. It had the qualities I love most about a good story and some really excellent performances. (9/10)
1	The story behind this film is actually quite interesting. You'll read about it here but for my part I am trying to explain this to others because I want to live in the future to see it happen someday as well. We're living in the digital age and there are many things about the world which have changed that make that world very difficult and I'm hopeful we can make it better. I've always been a big proponent of the power of science, and even the power of medicine, and the need for science to work with the knowledge and understanding of nature. This movie explains the effects of modern technology and how it affects human relationships in modern times. I don't have any problem believing it will happen that we can be one with nature and that we can create harmony and balance in the world. However, we also see this same scenario play out again and again in many different cultures, and I think we should not be so quick to judge people and their culture for how they present themselves and how they communicate with each other. And as these things are changing everyday, it would be a good idea to understand how and why we are so sure that it is going to be done in the future and not some far off nightmare. (10/10)
2	the film is a masterpiece and a real wonder! Well, the production value does not do justice to the quality of the film. Very different thing from the previous films because in each film the director is responsible for the production of the film. This one is very special because it was produced under licence for his studio and it came out of it. And that's very prestigious! The picture is a bit messy and it would be a different film if it didn't have the title of the film. A movie that's very short... Good performance of the director, although you should be reminded that the time is not right for the film. It is a little bit repetitive. That's why it's another movie by the director.
2	this film isn't for everyone and this is the reason why I decided to not review this one any more. Why does this film matter? It is simply a great time. It's time that you will never forget.
1	If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it.
2	Why the hell is it called "American Pie" and does the name of the movie sound like a parody?! The movie is basically one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. A movie without a good story, a good plot, a good characters, a good plot. I don't care if it is a satire...it isn't. It was a big movie that made no sense.
1	A solid thriller that might be worth trying out, but you might be disappointed. It feels too big for anything.
1	Fantastic flick. I was hoping that it could be the one to make the name of this movie famous for what it is.
1	It was an interesting and interesting film and i have to say that the acting was superb. It wasn't so much story as that it has a very interesting setting. It's good for the genre and for the movie.
1	This is a horror flick that wasn't very exciting. The acting was good and i feel that the story had a good balance. I'd recommend this for those that wish to watch something a bit different.
1	A pretty good movie for kids from a small town, it has a decent plot. It's not an original flick but it does have a few surprises in store.
2	Well, I have to say I really had high hopes for this one. I thought this would be their more melodramatic version of Midnight Madness. Instead this movie was more like some sort of R rating psychological horror movie involving the dead. I liked the idea of a small town struggling to deal with those who had died in the event, and some dark things were going on. However, the film just wasn't that good, just kinda okay.
2	"How could this happen in 2016?" There are so many ways this could've been written and maybe the ending would've been better in another movie. So much about this movie is just so melodramatic and cheesy, and so much effort put into them that I'm not sure this really holds up as a movie. But it all feels so rushed, and feels so scripted.
1	This film has really great music and great performances which make the movie really good. The story is amazing, and the cast all really worked well together. I really loved the ending, and I loved that they kept the romance.
1	I really liked this movie, but the main character was just a mess. It kinda made me wonder if they were going to try to make more horror movies all the same. It was a really great piece of theatre I think, but it just didn't hold up as a good movie.
2	The best thing that could've happened to this movie would've been if they had just done it the one way (make it in 4 hours) and the people would have loved it. I would have been all for that, as it would be fantastic to finally see their work as a new release. Instead they left us with this boring and mediocre film.
1	This is a very well made horror film, which didn't play out the way they had originally planned. It's a nice mixture of action, drama, horror, and comedy all packed into one great movie, and it was really well directed. There was also a good soundtrack, which really fit the concept of the story.
1	The first thing to know about this movie is that no character is alive or even close to a living person. They can only be thought up in an abstract manner to be like someone you'd like to be. There are no real problems to worry about, and no real plot to follow. You are being taken to a story, and that story is just so horrible that you probably didn't even need to go into it the first time you saw it, and that might be why it took a few re-watches to make it not bother you the same way it did before. The movie was the best I had seen in a really long time, it was just so bad it made my whole head hurt when I thought about it. In addition, there is a whole lot of swearing that I didn't really want to watch, and the ending of the movie was very painful because I just didn't want to feel this way about it again and I'm already going to feel a little uncomfortable about the rest of the movie because of that. The ending is also a lot slower than I expected it to be, and after the final scene, when the camera zooms out and the audience goes back to a normal space (not this world as you understand it, but even beyond your own self which should always be a safe zone), it's probably the slowest movie ever made to this point. I think it's very difficult to describe in words how awful this was, so you should probably just go watch it.
1	For every 90 seconds of good action there's 10% of bad. The most awful movie ever made, and I mean that literally. It literally felt like the most beautiful movie ever made, and that was about how far it got. It was so bad that I wanted to cry. The art was a mess. The story sucked and is a complete waste of time. I would rate this a 7/10 if not for the fact that everyone was just singing it the entire time when I saw myself in the movie. My only guess for how many times I watch this now is that every time, I cry or wish for the worst. Even though it was only 6 months ago, and this is almost like 3,000 words long, I still feel like it has to be a 7/10. That's just how bad it is.
2	I'm not gonna lie, my friend and I watched this movie on one night when we were both at work and we both decided to keep trying to come up with an ending in our head for the entire movie as we were both too tired to sit down and actually do anything. I did try on and off, but for the most part I just ended the movie with someone dancing and singing to a song we didn't recognize and the movie ended. I can imagine how you feel once you spend that much time trying to come up with an ending for a movie that is never meant to end, but in the end, I guess it's not the end, but whatever. I can't wait to write a blog post about the final minutes or something at least.
